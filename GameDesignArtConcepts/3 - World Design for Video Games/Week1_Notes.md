# What is a game world?

This is going be an introductory class.
It means that it's going lean more toward the conceptual
principles of world designs.
Having technical skills already can helps you prototype quickly, but
it doesn't mean you can make a better more thoughtful world just with this.

But looking at how video game worlds are structured.
  * How you move and how your avatar moves?
  * How these worlds can be drawn to life?
You'll have the tools to begin conceptualizing your world
before you even start programming it.

A video game world is a complicated illusion, a really complicated illusion.
Designing one is a lot of work obviously.
But what's also obvious is that it is highly rewarding during the whole process.


### Properties and Rules

Now under what properties, rules are these video games structured?
Well you will have to think about multiple things.
Try to be aware of it, when you play other games.

 * What defines a game world? The world you're actually playing with.
Is it gonna be a fictional, historical, fantasy, a dreamland?
Maybe it's just a sport game.
 * You have to think about game play mechanics.
Are you going to play in this world the same way you would play in any other?
Look how it is in real life.
How it is to go from one point to another on terrain.On field.
  * Now think also about these places.
This video world as places where you live and places where you die.
Obviously not that many games.
Maybe you will just spend your time dying.
But it's really important to think about some characters,
some people inhabiting this world might have to die.
Or maybe have to live their own life in this world.
And have the experience of that world.

It's really important when you this characters.
That is, maybe.
Like crew of character's team going on a quest and the journey.
  * How are they gonna interact with that world?
Think about the repetition, the time that it would take to go from
one point to another, to the movement you will have to draw in those worlds.
  * And think about all that when you play a game.
Are you gonna be playing as a stranger in a strange land,
someone who is completely new in a brand new world?
Or someone who has lived his whole life, basically, in this world?
Who is accustomed to the traditions, the law of the world.
Someone who is used to live there.

All of this comes back to making the world
appealing visually, making a great looking world.
That's something you think about when you start designing a game,
when you start designing a game world.
That's just something you think about constantly when you're playing a game.
  * Why is it appealing to you?
Because visually you feel compelled?
Because you like working in this lands?
Is it just a great looking world, or something that is more engaging?
Something that maybe expand what's happening behind these walls,
behind the fields.
What's happening outside.

### Story, the vertical spine

The story telling is truly the engine of the game.

  * When you play a game,
try to be aware of what is the world state when you start playing that game.
If you are there,
there's a reason, not just because you may be a messiah saving the entire galaxy,
I don't know, but maybe just because you have to be there at that point.
  * Think about why, why someone designed this world so
the place where you enter this world is where you actually start the game.
Is that tied to the story itself?
Is there a reason for it?
  * One thing to keep in mind, is the entire world going to be your playground?
Is there a bigger world outside the playable areas?
If there is a bigger world,
why are you starting on such a tiny part of that much, much bigger world?

Now let's talk about events.
  * What control will you have on this world?
  * Will you be able to decide anything?
  * What is going to lie on your path?
  * And if things are laying in your path,
what are you going to leave in the aftermath of your passage?

All of these are really fundamental questions when you're playing video games,
and obviously when you wanna try to design video game worlds.
The context matters, and not necessarily the place.
So when you're playing in a video game world,
it might not be necessarily where the majority of the action is taking place.
Maybe there is a war outside raging and
what you're playing is a completely different place, but the context of
the war will impact the game experience you will necessarily get.

Obviously the context and
the story together hand in hand are defining the game world, and
hence the experience you will have as a player, as maybe a character.
Imagination is key, and imagination will drive the scale of the world.
It's extremely important to think about the scale
of the world you're playing with.
  * All these actions and responses you will have to maybe take or
receive in that game will be defined by its scale.
And if your actions have an impact on the story itself,
then is it going to impact the world visually?
 * And there is the response.
Will your actions have an impact on the story, and if they do, well,
will they also have an impact on the world itself?
Is the world that tied to the story that it will be visually different, distinct?
Now obviously one of the fundamental things is how
are you going to leave a mark in that world as a player?
And how are you going to let the world mark you in return?

### Causes and consequences

In the previous video we talked about “Events” and “Responses.” These components are what cause consequences for your player/character in the game world. They are what drives your actions in the game.

As an example, here’s a classic trope:

“Eons ago the world was attacked by demons. They ravaged the land until a hero rose up, killed them, and banished them. After doing so, the world experienced a long period of peace that was unprecedented. Unfortunately, the demons have once again returned. It befalls upon you, Newly Appointed Hero, to face them and bring back peace to the land once again.”

The “event” is the world being saved by the hero for the first time. It sets a precedent and timeline for you to fit into. Your role is already defined: because the world was attacked once and saved, then it can be saved again.

More importantly, the world you’ll roam is your playground at stake. Its fate depends on you, but you’ll have to come to appreciate it first. You’ll discover its sights, maybe its culture, and of course, its inhabitants. You’ll feel responsible for saving it at any cost. Here, the objective of such a plot is to get you invested in the universe it takes place in. In order to achieve this, the world has to deliver. For you to save it, the world needs to have value to you. You have to spend time there and above all, you have to care about it.

But how do you come to care about a world that’s completely foreign to you? To do this, the world has to be designed in a way that compels you, drags you in, and welcomes you. Think of the classic “messiah” trope we read earlier. If the story puts you in the position of a messiah, or the savior, you already have a purpose and place in the world. You could also be a pariah, or the outcast; you may not arrive on the scene as the hero, but you are still placed in a defined position.

See the pattern here? World and Story in video games can be tied like a Moebius loop. One always influences the other in a tangled dance. You are brought into the world as a consequence of some earlier story with its own set of causes. Following this logic: your actions in the world might in turn cause new consequences, and more story, etc.

### Making a game world

Now where do you start?
How do you start?
Naturally there's no true recipe.
No improvisation either when it comes to designing video game worlds.
You sometimes have to follow what works.
  
  * Look at other games.
Analog, or digital.
Card games, board games, table top games.
They’re all designed to be a part of a world.
Everything takes place in a specific world.
Now, what exactly do you like?
What are you searching for?
Maybe something more realistic-looking
Leaning toward simulation maybe.
Or, escapism, another way.
Maybe trying to get something more unique,
something that you wouldn't find anywhere else.
  * Look at well designed in non-games, fantasy novels and TV shows and movies.
Just simply, would you wanna take a step in these worlds?
Why would you feel so attracted to this world?
And would you want to maybe have an impact on them?
Play with them?
Play in them?
  * Look at real physical sights.
What do you like in them?
Natural landscapes, monuments.
Why is it so attractive, so appealing, so grandiose sometimes, for
you to be near these physical sites?
How can you translate that in video game worlds?
In any kind of game world?

What feeling can you get from this?
Would you want to translate this specific feeling,
this sort of unique aura you can get from physical sites in video game worlds?
How can you translate that in the game?
Follow your instincts when you play video games, and
try to define why do you like being in this world.

On the website [Other Places](http://www.otherplaces.co.uk/), artist and writer Andy Kelly 
(aka Ultra Brilliant) creates video montages of environments from video games. 
Here, all the game play is eliminated so you can focus on 
the worlds themselves—and they are stunning to watch.


## Assigment (not submitted)

### description
Knowing what you like is a good thing. The point of this reflective assignment is to isolate and analyze the aspects of a game world that keep you playing and interested in the game.

To begin, pick one game (not a game series–just one game!) you feel strongly about. Use the title of the game as your project title. To help your peers, please include a reference URL to your game–a Wiki, an image, or the game itself.

Then, please answer the following three questions:

   1. Describe your game. Why do you find the game compelling?
   2. What defines your world? Tell your peers what makes your game world unique.
   3. How does the environment of the game affect the game play?
   
For the question that asks why do you find the game compelling, ask yourself:

  * Why do you like to play in this world?
  * Do you like being in that world?
  * What is it you find appealing or fun about this world? Is it the visuals, the story, the characters, or something else? 

To define your world, use any of these prompts to craft your answer:

  * Is your world constrained with boundaries (ie. with walls or fences) or does it infinitely expand?
  * Does the game world resemble a real-life environment or is it completely constructed?

  * If your world is completely unique what defines it? Think technology, culture, society, religion, etc…
  * If it resembles reality, is it contemporary or historical?

### Example
Take a look at my response about [Snatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatcher)

**Describe your game. Why do you find the game compelling?**

My game is Snatcher, a Japanese game only released in Europe and America on Sega CD/Mega CD in 1994. It is the second game directed by Hideo Kojima.

Snatcher takes place in the cyberpunk setting of Neo Kobe, Japan in what seems to be perpetual nighttime. The game draws its visual inspiration from movies such as Blade Runner and Akira. You play as an investigator whose task is to hunt down androids taking the place of humans in society, much like Blade Runner, and eventually uncover a vast conspiracy.

The game is essentially an interactive graphic/visual novel. The depth of its world then relies mostly on its evocative narrative and scarce animations in order to drawn you in. It has to be lauded that it all works, your actions being solely done by choosing between multiple lines of dialogs, text prompts, and occasional shooting sequences. Even with a very simple gameplay, Snatcher possesses a very expensive and thoughtful world.

The game is appealing for the sheer number of details and interactions of its world. It may appear dated today but the game managed to capitalize on a fantastic ambience (visuals and audio). It is possible to explore multiple locations of the city riding a vehicle, investigate scenes, talk to inhabitants and ultimately learn more about the world itself￼ through various encounters or even an extensive in-game database.

**What defines your world? Tell your peers what makes your game world unique.**

One unique feature is the robot companion, Metal Gear MkII, which makes it possible to call different characters in order to solve mysteries and gather clues. Most interactions like this one are available at any time. Calling a phone number you may randomly pick up during your investigation can lead to an unsuspecting turn. It is also possible (and encouraged) to order some ramen from a truck, go CSI on a decomposing body or jump from a car at full speed-- these are all memorable moments in the game. That sum of situations and occasional use of pop culture references gives Snatcher a pretty singular identity especially for a game relying heavily on its ambience and atmosphere to charm you.

**How does the environment of the game affect the game play?**

A lot of these elements are visible through all the game's sequences and aren’t essential to your case. Since the gameplay revolves around investigating a scene, it’s the sum of details in the environment that push you to try interacting with everything at hand. Trying every possible combination of actions on an object or prop might be key for the story to unfold. In order to do so, simple observation of the world and wit are necessary. In Snatcher, Neo Kobe City is truly at the center of the gameplay. Using the command “look” at a billboard in the streets to get intel or investigating every nook and cranny to solve a puzzle is the only way to progress. In Snatcher the world and the story evolve around decisions you take. Due to the technical limitations of the time, the game is scripted and doesn’t feature any kind of simulation. Anything you do, any command or input, will necessarily have an impact either on the world or the main character. Then, even apparently useless actions are meant to be. They make the story more dense and give meaning to the investigation. They make you part of the world.
