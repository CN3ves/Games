# A Whole World
## Inside the snow globe

### What lives there?
We will be putting down what will eventually define the look,
the ambience, and the atmosphere of your world.
How to convey a mood for a unique and engaging environment.

Now the first thing is, what is going to be living in that world?
One main thing in this world that now you will expand from that
volume you made in the previous week, that snowball of yours.

Well, let's talk about NPCs.
NPCs are **Non-Playable Characters**, they're a really important component.
Not in every video game genre of course but
they are, nonetheless, in a lot of video games.
So non playable characters are all those characters that you will encounter
in your way through that world.
They may be from a different species, from different race,
they may be from different planet.
They might not like you, you might be a messiah, or a pariah in this society.
You might have to gain their trust.
You might have to help them no matter what.
All this may be in the script.
Also, what are you going to get from them?
What is the outcome?
Is it going to bring you game play elements, like quests, better objects,
like in RPGs, helping characters to do this and that.
All of this is really up to you, what are you going to make from this indirect
confrontation with other characters.
Characters you will not be able to play with, but
you might have to talk to and have a conversation with.

There's also **enemies**.
Enemies are an important component of any video game,
even though you might not have any.
It might happen.
Well, if you have enemies, foes, they might be in your way.
They are probably going to be in your way.
What are they going to do?
What are they just doing when you're actually not in front of them,
battling them?
Why are they here?
And again, what is the outcome if you defeat them?
What are you going to get from them?
Are they going to be tied to the world so tightly that they're going to depend on,
you know, the habitat, the closed environments.
If you are in an ashen world in the forest are the enemies going to be
able to use the environment, maybe, to their advantage?

Something to think of which brings us to **creatures, monsters,
just in general animals**.
Are they going to be a friends or foes?
Are they going to be both?
Are they going to be there just for the decor?
Can you interact directly or indirectly with them?
And what is of use to you?
Maybe you can loot them and get extract from
the still warm corpse that you just slayed.
Well one series of video games, fan favorite in Japan, Monster Hunter.
In Monster Hunter, everything, every piece of design and
game play element revolves around the fact that you're hunting and
taking down giant creatures, dragons and wyverns.
Everything you see in our world from armors, weapons, even architecture,
is based from object, items, anything you can loot from these dinosaurs.
A skull, a giant skull, can become a house.
A giant tooth can become a sword.
And a scale can become a shield, anything.
In Monster Hunter, everything is tied to that world.
The world design and the game play are really going hand in hand.
All of this again is really just to bring more life to the world you're defining.

### Anchoring the world down
Now, what anchors your world down?
Let's get back to the story in the context of that world.
About, let's think about the facts.
What happens now in the world, as you're playing with it?
What happened before, as well?
It's, you know, a callback to the myth and the lore we briefly talked about, as well.

There might be battlefields, ruins,
remnants of other civilization in that world.
You know, you can get objects from these old things.
You can find old objects and make new things with it.
New, again, new weapons maybe to defend yourself.
That's a classic adventure game play, roaming the land, finding old things,
to craft new stuff.
Well these relics, artifacts, they can be part of contraptions.
Like the dungeons in Dark Souls.
And all these objects on your way,
they are one aspect of setting up a tangible environment.

Think of the forest and all the trees in it.
Well, all these trees have to be slightly different to give you an aspect of
realism.
You have to be eclectic in terms of
pure design environments in what you have in the video game world.
They all have to be united into one big world space.
Sky maybe if you have different environments. If they’re different planets,
they're still somehow in the same space.

You can respect what we call **biomes**.
Biomes are really important in contemporary video game design
because they are one way to respect natural environments,
deserts, forests, mountains, swamps.
They all are encapsulating different properties and aspects of,
a tiny world in itself, with a different fauna, a different plants, and vegetation.

You also maybe have to respect the laws of physics in that world.
Or not at all.
And if you're not respecting natural biomes, or
laws of physics, well, you have to define it.
Make it a design choice.
And assume it.
It may be great, but it is something that is to be well thought out.
It is something that has to come out as a choice.


One main component about those physics inside a video game world,
is that most of the time always bigger on the inside than it is outside.
You have to adapt the scale accordingly, in houses, for
example, with a lot of objects,
because you can't really adapt the scale accordingly to real laws of physics,
you can't perfectly respect it because then you will have issues with
perspective, which is only an illusion in video game design.
So as a side note, just an advice, you will have to rescale everything.
It doesn't have to be technical in a way, it might just be this come back and
forth between what would
feel right as a player bumping into these objects on your way.

And all those objects, again, maybe you will be able to gather them.
If you're a gatherer, if you're gathering all these objects, putting it in your
infinite pocket, in your satchels and bags, well, what are you going to do with it?
Are you going to actually legitimately be able to craft,
get other objects, or new objects out of old ones?
Are you going to just get them as souvenirs?
Are they going to be keys, puzzle aspects, puzzle components?
This may be only important in RPGs, in role playing games and
online games like Monster Hunter.
It's also a lot of models and textures.
It is a lot of work.
But it may be worth it.
Valuing items and objects is one long time running debate in video game design.
Too much, not enough, you have to do it accordingly to the game genre and
the targeted players.

## Let it shine 
### An Atmosphere

Now, let's try to give your world an atmosphere.
Let's get back to the visual development, to the aesthetic a little bit.
Now you will have to think about styles.
Maybe do a mish-mash.
Collide worlds and fuse them.
No one said you can't have science fiction magical steampunk as a world.
Or an **uchronia**.
An uchronia is a hypothetical time period, which means that a story
may be we never won World War II or the Cold War never happened.
And we're still using steam machines instead of computers.
All of these are design choices as well.
And you have to spend time on this.
It has to be thoughtful, it has to be obviously something you refine and
think about for quite a little while.
You have to really make a world that is in harmony and balanced in terms of spaces.

You might want to look again, around at real architecture, and spaces.
Again, **don't reproduce the scale, but maybe, instead magnify it**.
Make it monumental.
And as objects in space, the small ones, things that are moveable or not.
They have to fit, not just in term of scale again, but
this time in term of design.

If you have a world that is taking place in the 11th century in England,
well, you might want to research what type of objects,
what type of items they would look like exactly.
Or not, just give it a sense of mood and believability.
Maintain the illusion and think about oppositions and contrasts.
How they can go together or apart.

### Lighting is key
Let's talk about light for a moment.
How to light your world.
How to light a video game.
Well, lighting is absolutely fundamental. It's key in any video game design you do.
Not just the video game world, but it can be also part of the gameplay.

It can be overlooked and it doesn't have to be technical.
It's only a thoughtful choice you will make as a designer.
It can be extremely simple.
It's just a matter of shadows and spotlights.
What is going to be in the light?
What is going to stay in the darkness?
It can be just one part of the gameplay.
Can be part of the actual video game itself.
You can be organic in the placement of lights.
You can paint the light, really.
Look at how lighting was rendered during the history of visual arts or
more efficiently maybe in theater.

Well, it's exactly the same thing.
We already talked about video game world and spaces in video games as a stage.
Well, you would render this world the same way you would in a theater maybe.
And all these terms that you will hear or you have already heard a lot,
ambient occlusion, global elimination, shaders, and
physically-based rendering textures.
Well, all of these are just sprinkles on the cake, don't fall for
the marketing technical jargon.

It is eye candy, but only if it's used in very specific and defined situations.
A world can look original and engaging with the most simple lighting system.
You don't need extremely complicated devices from a video game engine, you can
just use light in simple ways as a matter of guidance in puzzles and mechanisms.

Some video game genre like survival horror are relying
heavily on lighting, obviously.
Some of the games will use day and night cycles,
which brings a sense of timing and pacing in the world that you are walking in.

Exploration of a cave.
When you dip into darkness, you might need that flashlight.
You can also think about particles, fireworks, guns and
magic if you have that in your world, in your video game.
Well, all of this can generate light in a way.
They're bringing a sort of specific spotlight to the environment.

Your lighting system can be slick and lean.
Lighting can be really expensive for computers and
video game consoles even though we have come a long way.
Well, you can also go in the complete opposite if it's your aesthetic and
make the lights really low key, low-fi.

Lighting can also be cheated, it can be free rendered, painted over,
you can have shadows that have actual textures.
You don't have to dynamic shadows and dynamic lights.
You can lower competition costs and still have really amazing
looking world if you think carefully about how to light it.

### In the Shadows
We’ve already established the importance of lighting. Just as our own world revolves around light changing from day to night, it is important to understand the role light plays in your game world.

Here are a few questions to ask yourself when designing your world’s lighting:

 * Is the light only aesthetic or will it serve some type of function?
 * Does the world have a day/night cycle?
 * Is it a very dark world with scarce sources of light? What are those sources? Is light accessed by a tool or simple fixture?
 * Does light have any impact on story or gameplay?

Every video game deals with light somehow. Even when there is flat lighting or solid color, the light is still deliberate. A minimalist game design might even mean a greater emphasis on lighting over other visual elements, because two-dimensional objects can still indicate and reflect light.

Believe it or not, video games make use of the same lighting principles established long ago within other art forms, like painting and illustration.

#### Atmosphere
What is “atmosphere”? It’s a word that refers to multiple elements, and one that keeps returning in this class. Let’s define those elements here:

  * Atmo means vapor, or air, in Greek; atmosphere is the envelope of gas surrounding our planet.
  * It is responsible for how we perceive light and its diffusion.
  * It is the sum of colors, textures, and shapes we see through light.
  * It defines a state of ambiance and drives a set of emotions, mood, and feelings.

Clearly, atmosphere is one of the most empirical and complex aspects of a game to define. It is also the most memorable aspect. This is because setting a specific light or atmosphere can dramatically influence the tone of your game because every other visual element will draw from it.

Take a moment to think of some of your favorite video games. Can you recall their color palettes? Is there an absence or presence of light? What was the overall mood of the game?

You might realize how many varieties of light already exist within your favorite game worlds, creating drastically different atmospheres and tones. A game like Ico is a great atmospheric piece because of its washed out and very bright open-air exteriors in contrast with its dark, somber interiors. Firewatch recently gave its minimalist visuals a very distinct light using the warm sunset of the great American landscape. Caves like the ones seen in Dear Esther or Dark Souls are also brought to life by the use of light (or lack thereof).

So, exactly how do you capture these elusive atmospheric qualities while game designing? It’s not that complicated. Your game is a sum of elements and locations will always drive the tone. For example, if your game takes place in a gothic castle then light could be scarce, shining through a layer of dense mist. On the other hand, if your game takes place in a temple on a bright, sunny mountain top underneath a clear blue sky, the tone differs dramatically. Remember that although a game’s atmosphere isn't solely dependent on lighting, light should bind all the visual intentions together.

#### Function

Light can be functional as well as atmospheric. In horror games especially, light guides a character forward, whereas darkness signifies danger and halts a character from moving forward at the same pace. When exploring a cave, dungeon, or dark mansion, it is preferable for a character to be equipped with a portable light source. When a light beam shines high in the sky, it can act a beacon for a character to travel toward. In this way, light can act as its own gameplay component.

Many games give light different functions throughout different scenarios. Luigi’s Mansion and Alan Wake are brilliant examples of ways light can be used as a tool to stun enemies, reveal hidden items, and create atmosphere all at once. And in the puzzle game Echochrome II, the controller acts as a light source while gameplay occurs in the casted shadows on the wall.

To put it bluntly, lighting is not an option in video game world design; it is a mandatory component. The further you can define the specific qualities and functions of your lighting, the stronger your world will be. 

### Colors
Now what goes with lighting is color.
Defining a set of colors, thinking in palettes, tones, and multiple sets for
a consistent environment is one really essential part of world design.
Think hot and cold colors, complimentary ones.
How they're going to convey a different set, a different feeling to the player.

If you have any ecclecticism of destinations, a desert, mountains,
caves, sprawling cities or small towns, soccer fields or tennis courts,
well, all those places, they're leaning toward a different set of colors.

If you have just a simple gradient, which is possible in a video game,
having just solid colors or a gradient,
everything that is standing out in this world well should have a meaning.
All of this can be decided no, has to be decided, early on and
as to depend either on the story and the context of the overall gameplay.
It is just a choice, just something you choose as a game designer.
If you think about it this way, what the players can do or cannot do.
If this is visible and labeled, you an use colors for
that to guide them, where to go, what to do.
It's a matter of partitioning what is what, for you, and for the players.
**Don't overdo it** though, keep it really simple.
You really don't want to have your players being hammered during the whole time
they're playing the game, the entirety of it, what they can or what they cannot do.
You want them to get it early on and just keep it rolling.
Which brings us to the UI, the color of the interface, the user interface,
is very important.
It's not quite a world design matter, but it has to be mentioned somewhere.

Players will have their eyes on the UI for hours and hours, at best, maybe.
So it should never be straining for them to look at it.

### Color your world
In addition to setting mood and ambiance, color can be used to guide players through a game world by 
helping them understand their surroundings and identify areas of interaction. 
We've included a few strategies below:

#### Color as Signifier

Red and blue, for example, are universal signs of antagonism. One is “hot” the other is “cold.” This pairing is visible in political parties as well as sports teams. They are used in strategy games or battles to identify two factions, armies, or teams. See Age of Empire, Halo, or [Red vs Blue](https://roosterteeth.com/series/red-vs-blue) by Rooster Teeth for examples of how color signifiers play out within video games specifically.

The opposing army or team might also have a visibly different design or style. 
A difference in geometry aids in the color wars.

#### Color and Atmosphere/Mood

Similar to the red vs. blue pairing mentioned above, color can code a game world with a specific mood.

For example, a warm, brightly colored environment can be placed in opposition to a blue, cold, and icy land. Warm colors can also depict “hellish” places and destruction, (i.e. fire, lava), while cool colors are generally associated with more “clinical” environments and tend to feel more disturbing, off-putting, and nightmarish.

However, these color tropes are not always stable. A good example of atmosphere/mood driven by color can be seen in Bloodborne, where color changes on a grand scale as the player roams the game’s world. As a result, the player never gets too familiar or comfortable in the world because color continuously evolves from one level to another. 

#### Color as Classification System

A color legend can tell a player how items should be classified, from “harmless” to “dangerous.” Colors can also determine how one item might interact with another item in the game (i.e. green goes with green, purple with purple, etc.)

If “looting” is a mechanism of the game and items can be acquired or found, then identifying items by color may be a necessity. The game Diablo, or more recently Destiny, uses a system ranging from green, to blue, to purple, etc in order to classify an object’s rarity (and by extension its quality).

Of course, some games are more subtle than others. The Witcher 3 classes color less consistently, relying on separate color systems for potions, armor, and upgrades. Other games, like Fallout 4, don’t have a color classification system all (despite looting still being a prominent action). It’s up to you whether you want items to be visibly “colored” in the game world itself. The system might be visible only in the backend, in the UI, or in the inventory after these items have been acquired by the player. 

#### Color in the Environment

A contrasting color can also attract attention to an object or point of interaction within a world. A good way to clarify the player’s next move (be it turning a lever, pressing a button, climbing a ladder, or sliding down a gutter) is to “tag” these interactive elements with color.

### Final Round

One final, maybe tiny, bitty thing to think about is that you,
as a creator, are creating video game world and
video game environments for others, to be played and enjoyed.
Others have to take pleasure in what they see and what they experience.
Will you let players re-appropriate the world you created?
Will you let people use mods,
let the community create and generate content for it?
Let it sustain for a much longer time than maybe what is planned?

All of this is a really important component in how you
feel as a player about a video game, and think that video
games have to stay in memories for a much longer time than when they are played.
In a few years, when you have forgotten a game and played again and
feel again that sensation, that first sensation you felt when you
started playing it for the first time, that is something really important,
really meaningful, as a player, of course, but as a video game designer.

What you want to do is leave the mark and let the video game mark other people.
It's really fundamental to just not let a video game maybe die but
generate a community around it. Generate maybe art,
anything that can keep the world you created alive for as long as it can be,
for another generation of players to discover it one day.

## Assigmnet (not submitted)

### description
To do this, imagine yourself as a player in your world. Write a short narrative playthrough that leads your character to an initial goal in the game. Focus your playthrough on just a small section of your world, but it can be any part of the game.

While the focus here should be on the environment of the game and how your player/character will navigate through it, in your description you must include:

  * an action you take in that world (opening a door, getting a key, etc)
  * a resident of the world you encounter (NPC, enemy, creature, etc)
  * and one object or item. The player needs to interact with the item in some way. 

Write about what the player sees and does each step of the way. The idea here is vivid description of the world, the task at hand and the goal.

In addition, upload the map or model and a selection of images to help illustrate the playthrough and give your peers some background. You must upload at least one image, but there are four additional spaces for extra images, if desired. Do use your images and photos from Weeks 2 and 3, but if you have additional drawings or sketches at this point you may include them as well.

### example

I'm sharing with you the opening walkthrough for my proposed game, Brimstone Cove, in which three children summon an ancient being and fasten a relationship with him while they help him adapt to his new surroundings.

**Prologue: Episode 0**

It's 1966.

The Cold War is at its tensional peak, the fear of atomic mayhem is high and Nevada was regularly nuke tested. No one has walked on the moon yet. Young Americans were at war in Vietnam and The Beatles were on tour in the US. Star Trek was on TV and Batman was Adam West. Batman was everywhere. Walt Disney died. Westerns are now filmed in Spain by Italians. England won the World Cup. Skirts got shorter. Venera 3 crashed on Venus. The Doomsday Clock was at 23:53 and the cover of Life stated: “Your dog is in cruel danger.”

**Game Start**

It’s almost nighttime. Lyndon is at an extremity of the field around his parent’s house. He knows he has to come back home. Something glows in the barn as he passes by.

**Path1**

He goes directly back home. The next day, if he gets into the barn, the slug is gone.

**Path2**

While night falls, Lyndon opens the small gate on the fence and grabs the lantern to explore the barn. Inside he finds the source of the glow: a giant slug. It doesn’t glow itself: rather the glow comes from the fireflies that hover around it. They flee as Lyndon approaches.

Lyndon touches the slug and passes out. He experiences nightmarish visions.

He wakes up a little later in the barn, gets up and returns to the farm house. Inside, his mother prepares dinner and his dad watches TV (The Ed Sullivan Show). His sister is lying on the floor, drawing. After talking to all of them, the dinner is ready and they have a general conversation. After dinner’s over, he climb upstairs and uses the bathroom (washes himself, brushes his teeth, and puts his pajamas on) before going to bed. He reads a bit of The Avengers, and falls asleep.

The next day, he says “Bye!” to his mom and steps out of the farm house. He heads to the forest. As he leaves the farm and gets on the Old Road leading to the woods he has successive thoughts. At the crossroads he meets Bernard. Bernard tells him there is an issue at the gas station and therefore the south road (going into town) is closed.

He keeps on exploring in the woods. The trees get denser. He comes across a clearing, and in the middle he sees his two friends, Thaddeus and Callista. After a brief exchange with both of them, they all turn toward a monolith covered in moss with a couple of birds on top. Rays of sunlight hit the structure through the foliage. Thaddeus draws a knife out of his bag. The blade shines in the sun. The kids take turns and cut the palms of their hands. Then Thaddeus theatrically plunges the blood-covered knife into a crack at the monolith’s base. The birds fly away.

Nothing happens until a loud creaking, crumbling noise occurs. A vortex draws at the base of the monument and a bright red beam of light emerges from the monolith’s top. The whole world trembles. The monolith cracks open and a tentacular silhouette appears while an emphatic chant can be heard. The kids lie on the ground clinging to each other.

Everything stops. The vortex disappears, the light beam is gone and the only thing that remains is a big pile of slime where the monolith was standing. While the kids regain their standing, some loud moanings emanate from the pile. Lyndon grabs a stick nearby and pokes the slime. Tentacles rise and the heap moves and expands. The heap, now clearly a creature, opens its eyes, keeps moaning slowly and wiggles its limbs. The kids are in awe.

**End of prologue**
