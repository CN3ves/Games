# The Way You Move

## Defining the Game World
### Visualizing the game world

And now, we're in Week 3, already.
In this week, what we're going to start by doing is
talking a little bit about how to visualize a game world.
Not just a video game world, but any game world in general.
Well then, one of the first things that comes to mind, is the flat map.
The flat map, is not necessarily about a flat world.
You can have all the details on your map stating the topography of it,
the height, and all the important parts, and
spaces and places you might want to visit as a player.
Well, that's a classical representation.
The top-down representation.
It goes back to tabletop games, like Dungeons and Dragons.
Here you can have a god-like view where you see the world,
the entirety of it, all at once.
Something that your character might not be able to see.
You, as a player,
or as a video game designer, can see the entirety of the world, and see
exactly where you, as a player stand at a tiny point maybe in a much bigger world.
Here, we are talking mostly of open world, video games.
If the character is a cartographer,
this big open world game, and is maybe role playing game.
If he is revealing the map, if he is revealing the important points here, like
caves, maybe or like loot places.
You will have the ability, like in modern times to use a GPS, sort of, to pinpoint,
point of interest, and have the system guide you to that specific location.
Something you can't do, while you're horse riding, but something that the game, and
the game designer, will let you do to
facilitate the way you can see yourself in that video game world.
Another way to define this map is to bring it in volume, create a model,
and dollhouse of parts of world or the world itself.
If you're doing a three dimensional map of volume, where you can see exactly
where the temples, the caves, and living spaces are all going together.
It is a comprehensive way to guide the plays,
to let them understand how the world itself works.
Here you are an architect, like a supreme architect of a much bigger world.
And it's like in real life,
it has to respect some properties of actual real life spaces.
And then, none at all, because video game world, or virtual worlds in general.
Have to be an ersatz.
There's a paradox in all that, and
we will talk more extensively about it later in the course.
But virtual worlds are different.
You have to think boundaries.
You have to think of technical and practical limits.

### Level Design
In this video we are going to talk a little about level design.
Just an intro to get you started.
First of all, we are going to break down signification of these two words:
Level and Design.
Level, first, according to the Webster dictionary a level
is a practically horizontal surface or area.
And I like this practically here because it means that it's not exactly something
perfectly flat.
It doesn't have to be.
It can be just a surface, an area, a terrain basically,
something that can have a little bit of life in it.
But it's just a tiny corner of the world.
Then you have Design.
Again, according to Webster's dictionary, a design means to conceive and
plan out in the mind.
And that's exactly what level design is, is bringing your ideas,
your plan, your maps, your idea for World into a surface,
into a volume, into a space, basically.
Level design is designing spaces, and most importantly,
what's going to be in their spaces.
So you can have obviously a whole lot of different things in this spaces,
you will have to think about these walls.
You will have to expand from the map, rise from the plan, and
think about obstacles, traps, natural dangers, and artificial ones.
Like falling to your death.
You will have to design a space that you can explore like a maze.
And maybe get lost in it.
We will talk about the garden which is really competent about level design and
a real interesting analogy in this terms.
You will have to think about how to escape these worlds, how to escape this maze.
And you will have to define the architecture involved in your space.
It can be extremely simple.
What I want you think about also, just a little bit,
at the end of this video is also about Micro and Macro design.
Thinking about the scale that, you know, you're going to throw your character or
your players or your entire army, any kind of entity you're going to play with,
what is going to be the scale of the world.
The playable world or the world in general.
Is it going to be a tiny, tiny place?
A tiny corner of the galaxy, or the galaxy itself?
With multiple styles.
We're going to talk about all that, and we're going to define this,
too, in two parts, just after this video.
 
### Bordering the World

In this video,
we're going to talk about how to define your game world in the frame of its game play.
And that's really important.
What you will have to do is bottle in your world, putting up some fences.
What you have to do here is think of the limit of the world.
Of this space, this area that you're going to play with, and play in.
You will have to think about this enclosed world as something that is autonomous.
It needs to be obviously tied to the story and its context.
So what you can do if you think about
having an entire planet to explore is why you have only this planet and not others?
If you can travel through space, why can you do it?
All of that should be tied to your story.
So let's say again you have a cyber punk city or you have an entire planet and
only one of you want to have maybe is a tiny piece of it that you want to be playable.
It doesn't matter,
what you need to think about is what is outside the reach of this playable area.
You have to think about that context in a much broader space
than the space where you're actually going to be able to play.
And that's really important, it gives your world a sense of depth, a sense of volume.
If you have characters that are like bringing stories from other countries,
other landscapes, other environments,
other towns than just the town where you have the action, taking place.
And you can find books about the law of the entire world.
Well, it's going to make your game and it's going to make it's world way more
interesting for anybody playing it and that's really important to think about.

### The bigger picture
One way to make a game world feel more authentic is to make its universe bigger. Even if there are areas you can’t virtually explore as a character, designing spaces beyond the game’s playable area adds to the world’s legitimacy.

Think of it this way: just because you’ve never visited Hawaii does not mean it’s not there. You might live in Ohio, but you know Hawaii exists because you eat the bananas that are grown there in your cereal every morning.

A game world works the same way. We learn of its depth and expansiveness without necessarily being able to play every part of it.

To understand this a little better, let’s look at few examples from popular games:
Example 1: [Elder Scroll](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/Map_tamriel.jpg)
[Map of Tamriel, the world at the center of the Elder Scroll series]
Until recently, the world of Tamriel could only be seen in small pieces. Games from the Elder Scroll series would take you to a specific province, but you knew of the existence of the other lands through myth, literature, and the political and race conflicts occurring in the game. 

Example 2: [The Witcher](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/World_map.jpg)
[Northern realms from The Witcher game series]
Another example is the world of The Witcher, which is based on an extensive book series. Despite the Witcher games only offering a select few locations for you to travel through, you can still observe the vastness of the world The Witcher takes place in:

Example 3: [Fallout 4](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/Fallout-4-Map.png)
[Fallout 4, 2016]

Fallout 4 is one of the few games that allow you to go “beyond the map.” The game takes place in a world titled the Commonwealth which, just like the previous games of the series, is based on actual geographic areas in the United States. While the first two games and Fallout New Vegas inhabit California and Nevada, the third game is set in Washington, DC. The Commonwealth from the fourth installment is based on Boston and its surrounding area.

The Commonwealth world of Fallout 4 doesn’t quite match reality and its scale is obviously altered. However, it offers us an interesting model of how to adapt real-world geography to a game (Assassin’s Creed is another example.) One of Fallout 4’s most intriguing design components is the player’s ability to go beyond what appears to be the limit of the map. The map’s bottom left corner reveals to be a fully playable area with new points of interest and locations to explore, so that the player can actually “cross” the map’s borders and wander into what previously looked like an inaccessible location.

Example 4: [Mass Effect](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/Mass_Effect_3_Galaxy_Map.jpg)
[Fanmade map from the Mass Effect series]

In contrast to the previous example, the Mass Effect series lets you gaze at a galaxy and the promise of its exploration. In reality, only a few places can be visited. Most planets are only there to serve as decor. The effect of a the world’s overwhelming scale is nonetheless present on the player.

Example 5: Elite Dangerous, No Man’s Sky, etc.
Games like Elite Dangerous or No Man’s Sky host randomly generated universes that allow you to shape worlds as you’re playing them. These simulated “persistent” worlds enable you to carve more and more detail into huge and fully explorable environments in real time. This creates a complex interaction between gameplay and storytelling that can keep things interesting.

As a bonus, here’s an antique map of [Brussels](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/c3_o.jpg)
Look at how organic it looks! Try to imagine the flow of human life going through its streets and plazas. Ask yourself: Would it be functional in a videogame setting? Would it be playable?

**To summarize**:
Some devices that allude to a world outside the world of the game (a “bigger picture”) are:

    An artifact that describes another part of the world (traces of an old myth)
    An NPC describing a part of the world (different costume or accent)
    A map of the world in the game
    A map or artifact IRL (i.e. a wiki, a book of “law,” i.e. Game of Thrones)

These devices can:

    Expand the player’s sense of the world without making it playable (especially a sense of progression)
    Add to the believability of the world that you’re in (making the story richer)
    Make the world and its rules consistent
    A marketing ploy: a larger world expands the possibilities for sequel

### The Garden
Here in this video, I want to to talk about the garden.
Why the garden?
Think about a garden and how it's made, how it's constructed,
and how it's engineered.
It's engineered for leisure.
It's engineered to walk in.
A lot of contraptions in gardens like mazes are exactly
what you can find in video games, even though you might not recognize them.
Now what I want to do is talk a little bit about two different types of gardens.
The French gardens.
The French gardens are altered, the paths are not grass.
They are clearly labeled and defined.
They are color coded and you don't need any arrows.
You know exactly where you are going.
It doesn't mean that you can't have multiple infringements,
that you can't which path to take.
But, you will have avenues clearly bordered by trees.
You will have hay and gravel on the floor.
You will have a sense of really ordered spaces.
And then you have English gardens.
English gardens became really popular with this simple idea.
How to bring the wild into a garden, into a space where you can go to leisure.
In English gardens, you have this
feeling of being in a world that is much bigger than what it is.
And as you walk into an English garden,
you might see more nature than contraption.
In the end, all of this is also design and perfectly ordered.
It's just ordered the way nature for the time was understood.
And that's exactly what you do in video games,
when you create games which are seemingly lush, detailed environment.
You look at nature and you try to emulate and
bring all these aspects into your game, into this world.
So that when your player will walk into these trees and these forest, and
these field
and even cities,
it will have the feeling of being into an actual space.
A space that is not just defined through rules and mathematic, and algorithms.
But space that is wild, and just left to nature.
Obviously, all of that is geometry, algorithm, and mathematic,
but thinking about how to emulate an aspect that is seemingly uncontrollable and
free is what will make your game more interesting.
Here, I want to talk about the Ha-ha.
What is the Ha-ha?
Well the ha-ha is one of my favorite ideas ever in video games and gardening.

The Ha-ha is a trench.
A trench is going to act as a divider in your garden between spaces.
It's going to border the world or the garden without having to put any fence,
an invisible barrier and destroy the view.
The way it works is if you stand in the middle of the garden and
see what's all over, you will see all the gardens, all the field.
The view is not going to be interrupted by any kind of wall.
But then as you get closer to it and bump into that trench, that ha-ha, and that's
what you all exclaim yourself, then you get at the end of the world, basically.
It just defines what is going to be this playable area.
What is going to be this garden, this playground.

It doesn't mean that the playground from the view can expand out of its boundaries.
But the playground itself is contained in the limit of the ha-ha.
The limit of the trench.

### Navigation and Time
Then what about navigation?
How are you going to move as a character, as yourself as a player in this world?
Does it mean that when you will roam the land in your newly created world,
really old ancient galaxy, will you be on foot?
Will you be riding a horse?
In other crafts, oh,
like drive a giant space ship from planet to planet, all of these means that
transportation will transform the way you will move through time and that's a really
important component to think about when you think about designing game space.
Everything you do in a game takes time, even though it's not the exact same time
that it would take you to go from Los Angeles to San Francisco,
you have to think about how you will compress this time then necessarily and
if you're playing a tiny corner of the world.
It might take you seconds to go from one point to another.
You might run across a lot of adventures in these few seconds or minutes.
It's really important to keep in mind that as you move in a video game world,
your story will unfold.
It will also lay out events.
Triggering some new effect.
It's really, really important to think about how the world can
be impacted by your choices and
by what you do, hence, the way you move into this world and vice versa.
Is the world going to change yourself and your character?

### Two types of navigation
In the previous video, we discussed movement in a video game space on a broader scale.

Now let’s be more specific: When designing a world, it’s important to define all the modes of transportation possible because these modes are linked to the time you’ll spend as a player in the game.

Think about how each specific type of transportation in the world will allow you to advance through the game’s various areas or levels. You might ask yourself the following questions: Are the players restricted to walking only, or can they run? Will they have access to a horse, a car, a boat, or a plane? If they don’t have immediate access to a horse, a car, a boat, or a plane, could they possibly find one through gameplay? All of these scenarios can increase your speed of locomotion and allow you to travel faster and farther within a game.

There’s no exact time-space unity in video game design. Any game has the potential to move you anywhere within its world(s) in an instant, but some video game genres lean more towards open worlds than others. Within these, there are two common types of time-based movement:
Type 1: Timed Locomotion, or “Real Time”

Unlike the real world, videogame worlds have to be dense, compact, and filled with a seemingly endless number of possible interactions. One way to accomplish this is through timed locomotion, or “real time” locomotion. Timed locomotion is a deliberate design choice that serves as an experience gathering device for the player. Even though it requires the player to spend more time in the game world, the pace of the game is not necessarily slower. It’s a good way to ramp up tension because it requires players to physically move through the world in order for events to happen. This mode of transportation generates encounters, enemies, friends, item discoveries, mysteries, etc. It can also offer sights and vistas for players to contemplate or rest within the game. In this sense, it allows players to weave their own narrative as explorers outside of the game’s main storyline.

In videogame design, timed locomotion is artificial. It exists in order to create a sense of space and time for players to explore and create memories. It creates a sense of wonder rarely observed in any other medium. Players will remember roaming the land, discovering views and other surprises the world offers long after the game is shelved and the machine turned off, possibly taking dust.
Type 2: Immediate Locomotion, or “The Great Glass Elevator”

Some games rely on modes of locomotion that transport players directly from one point to another instantaneously. We’ll call this “The Great Glass Elevator” type, after Roald Dahl’s book Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. This type is at work in games that include a map where players can directly select a point of landing. By doing so, players can automatically transport themselves to any chosen spot within the game.

You might be wondering how this type of transportation affects the game’s story. In most cases, your character is theoretically moved while “time” is compressed into an ellipse, like a narrative black hole. Other games might play off the idea that your character travels through portals or wormholes and has the ability to bend time and space. In the end, it doesn’t really matter whether the game offers context for this traveling system or not. Immediate locomotion is part of the nature of video games that we accept.

Most “open world” games are using a combination of both types. Role-playing games -- like Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption, for example -- offer the ability to teleport, but only to places you’ve already discovered within the game. This means your player must physically reach these points before you’re able to conveniently “warp” to them. Other games, like the Dragon Quest series or Pokemon, require you to posses a special ability or creature to do so. However, certain environmental obstructions (like being inside a cave or dungeon) could mean that “flying” directly to any point within the game is not always possible during gameplay. Other games offer instant travel as more of a necessity, allowing players to teleport themselves back to checkpoints or other key locations within super expansive worlds.

As we move on from this lesson, keep in mind that methods of transportation are less important in games that involve escaping the problematic: like puzzle games, fighting games, or any game taking place in an isolated environment.

[Your Moves](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/sml1.jpg)
[Concept drawings from ICO, 2001]

As you develop your game world concept, ask yourself: Will your game include specific moves? Will you be able to wall-run (Prince of Persia), use a grappling hook (Uncharted 4), be death from above (Assassin’s Creed), fart (Oddworld), scuba-dive (Endless Ocean), or hold someone’s hand (Ico)?

Keep in mind that some moves are not integral to gameplay but might add to the overall experience of being in the world, i.e. petting your wolf friend (Far Cry Primal).

### Level design in local spaces
Creating closed or local environments comes with a few rules. “Local” refers to spaces where a certain unity of time and space exist in relation to your character’s movement. This means that the size/scale of your level needs to correspond with your character’s ability to explore it in real time (without ellipses, teleportation, or any other modes of instant transportation).

A lot can be drawn from architectural design and set design in theater and cinema. After all, what you want to achieve here is the same: the illusion of a space. Mazes, themed parks, and gardens also share many of the same rules and can be useful models to consider.

Here are some considerations to help you conceptualize a successful level design that people want to play:
Step 1: [Progression](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/design_3.jpg)

[Flowchart from Maniac Mansion, 1987]

The first thing you should do when designing a level is map the progression. Since this depends on the type of game you’re creating, mapping can be done in more than one way. The most important thing to remember is to keep your map minimal and clear. Your goal is to define where everything connects. There should be no visual details, and only a few gameplay elements should transpire. Of course, elements allowing players to travel from one place to another—like keys, contraptions, or mechanisms like doors or elevators—have to be present.

Step 2: [Solid Spaces](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/ico12.jpg)
[From ICO, 2001]

Next you can lay down the foundations of the environment itself. An axonometric or isometric view can help you conceive a three-dimensional environment. If the game is two-dimensional, like a sidescrolling platformer or adventure game (i.e. traditional Castlevania/Metroid type), the representation differs but the process is still the same.

Think about the actual architecture of the space(s). What obstacles are in the way, and what structures the environment itself? As you dig into these details, remember to leave aesthetics aside as much as possible; unless aesthetics are what’s driving gameplay motives, these can be defined later.

Some games like Assassin's Creed or Uncharted try to enhance gameplay (i.e. climbing, platforming) with architectural structures. For example, a really intricate castle might improve a maze-like environment and the occasional structural traps that can occur along the way (Dark Souls is one game that excels at this.) Alternating between monuments and open space will also change the order of value between your character and the environment. Imagine you’re composing space with your character as an anchor point instead of the focal point; it doesn’t always have to be the center of attention. An occasional shift in focus can help with pacing and add to the game’s entire experience.

Try drawing from your own experience in real life. It’s helpful to look at existing sites and structures (manmade or natural) in order to incorporate their qualities into your level design. You can also look at successful examples from other games.

Check out the Additional Resources page for some ideas, examples, and approaches to level design. 

### Tools of the Trade
As we move into building the physical forms of our worlds, let’s use this moment to share tips with each other: What are the tools or techniques you use to design a world?

For starters, here are two resources I recommend on making and reading maps specifically: 
[fantasticmaps.com](www.fantasticmaps.com)
[Here Be Cartographers: Reading the Fantasy Map](http://www.nicholastam.ca/2011/04/18/here-be-cartographers-reading-the-fantasy-map/)

## Leave a mark on the world, let the world mark you
### Moveset
Let's talk about leaving a mark in the world, or letting the world mark you.
As a player, as a character.

So now think about moves.
We're getting a little most specific here.
Think about the movements your character, characters,
anything you play with, will be.
Think about the moves sets, your moves, as they are.
Walking, climbing, running, striding, crawling, strafing.
Any kind of gesticulation.
Another analogy - the ballet of the dance.
Well when you dance, you dance in a specific space.
A stage.
Well again, a stage is another word to define the level, and
has been used in early games.
Well, how do you move on that stage?
On that stage of life?
As you mimic life and illusion just as you do on a stage, in a play, in a dance.
Then think about the repetition.
Again, like a dance like when you have to learn it.
You have to repeat movements after movements until you master it.
Well, it's the same in a video game you have a defined list instead of moves.
Because that's the way video games are thought of, with a set of animations,
really rarely characters have the freedom to express themselves completely freely.
Most of the time, you will have to repeat
through the same set of animations to repeat the same movements.
Again opening a door, opening a notebook.
Dropping a gun, recharging it.
Anyways, all of this has to be repeated multiple, multiple times.
The effect in that is that you start to learn.
You start to learn how to move in this world.
And you start to learn how to move in this world because the environment
has an effect on you.
It's impacting you.
The more you will have to open a trap or walk on a wall.
You know, some games let you walk literally on walls.
Well if you have to do that set of moves it’s because the environment
first lets you do it.
And because you have to do it to inform
a story because it's part of a much larger context.
So as you learn how to move in a game will your character learn as well?
Will it be only you learning, gaining more dexterity?
Well that's how the environment can play a really important part on you as
a player and not just as a context, but as pure mechanic.

### From point A to point B
Now, let's talk about going from point A to point B.
Here, we're getting really specific going from one point of the world to another.
And by that, I mean not just one part of the world, but one part of the story.
How to start and end your story as you walk, move through it.
And also what obviously is going to be between point A and point B.
Think about that journey that you will have in between.
And here we can talk about that game, Journey.
Here when you start the game all you will see in the background is that mountain,
ominous mountain.
It just takes all the space.
That's where you have to go.
That's your set goal, your progression.
All you will do is try to reach that mountain.
Get on top of it, you know it.
It's where you have to be, not just where you have to go.
And here, in Journey but
like many other games you have to think about, what's going to happen.
What kind of enemies, what kind of encounters you will have?
In a game like Journey, you will encounter other characters which are other players.
Literally you will help other players, and it will help you reach that mountain.
You will have adventures with them.
You will have maybe a sense of story unfolding.

The environment will change, and the feeling, the whole learning experience you
will have all through the game will define your gaming experience.
So how can you transform that feeling and
transfer it into other games, your own game?
How can you create the journey?
Well, as you go from one point to another, to point A to point B, you can have
a whole set of subsidiaries in between spaces, arenas, towns, dungeons.
If you go from one planet to another will it be just a travel and
will journey be in that planet to reach, or will journey be the travel itself?
Is traveling, going through the world, going to be that journey,
that story, that sense of wonder you want to carry all through the game.
Another concept, Door-monster-treasure called Hack-and-Slash in English.
What you do is opening a door, finding a monster, getting a key from it and
then you repeat.
You just find another door and with the key you just found you open that lock,
get to another door, kill another monster, get another treasure.
In dungeoning games like that, or like Dark Souls,
the world is actually open right from the start it is just locked.
If you go into some past that is still, often from the start,
you might find a way to unlock the other doors.
Which leads you to more unlocking, more monsters and more unfolding of the story.
In a game like Dark Souls, you are literally marking the world.
You can leave messages on the ground for other players, so
that they will know exactly what to expect.
What trap, where is the door, where is the key?
And obviously you can lie.
All of these participate to create obviously the atmosphere,
the ambiance, but also create a story line.
A story telling element that is really important, shared between other players,
here the environment is the story itself.

### Linear vs. Non-Linear
Now let's talk about non-linear versus linear game play.
Well, what is non-linear game play in a video game world?
Well, you can think about games we talked about.
Dark Souls, Resident Evil.
These are non-linear.
You can also think about Super Mario Bros 3, where in between linear levels, you,
and on the map, and you have to choose which level you would do, in what order.
This is non-linear game play.
A lot of different genres of games are more prone to no- linear game play.
Well, then you can think of Hack and Slash, door with a treasure

genre we talked about before, are role playing games, which are,
like the perfect example of environments that are non-linear,
that allows you to choose in what order you're going to do quests, events, and
how you want the story to unfold as you go.
Well, you can just leave the story on the side and as it's called,
do a side quest, go on another mission.
Well, think about all that when you design a game.
Think about how expanded the world can be if it's non-linear.
Now let's think about Linear gameplay, linear progression.
A game like Limbo for example.
is one of the few examples of purely linear gameplay.
Your going from my point to another which is a really super long level.
Where you go to point A to point B,
have a lot of adventures, a journey in between maybe, but no way of coming back.
Think of it when you develop the game.
Do you want to leave the ability to the player or
the character to come back and forth maybe?
To look behind?
Or do you want only this sort of rush for life, always going forth.
All you want to do is vanquish in your way.
Just conquering that land.
Well, that's linear game play.
It's something you need to think about when you design a game.
Will you put the accent on the story and create maybe more of a linear experience?
Or non-linear one,
when your character will be free to explore that universe of yours.

### The Grey Box
Alright, in this final video let's talk about the grey box.

What is it?
Well, let's think about this.
Scrap everything we've seen through all the previous videos.
Just keep the core of it, the core of what defines your game world.
Just make it great, boxy, simple, minimal.
Keep just the minimum of what is necessary for your games to be played.
Will the game still be fun, engaging, and thrilling if it's just grey, and
simple and minimal?
Well, that's really an important concept.
That's what's used in the video game industry quite a lot.
Obviously, you don't have to do it.
It's one way of experiencing the theory of gaming, the theory of fun.
Well, if you can make the game fun by just moving through all those boxes,
moving through space.
Repeating movements, exactly what we saw all those different classes.
If you can manage to keep the strays a vertical spine.
The move set as a dance, a ballet, that you can keep repeating, and learning, and
still having fun doing it after hours and hours.
Think about it.
Think how many times you will do the same thing again, and again, and again.
If it's still fun to do it in a world that is nothing but grey.
Well, then, you have a great game.
And keep expanding from that grey box.
Think about how lush it can be.
But before it gets detailed, lush and lively, well, make it fun with nothing.
Wood sticks, just pieces of blocks, nothing.
If the game is fun with nothing, then,
it's going to be fun when you will add all the spices, and everything else.

### Asignment (not submitted)

### description 
Here you are asked to build on the visual style of your world and begin to give it shape and volume. The purpose of this assignment is to conceptualize a world’s levels to advance the game narrative and flow.

For this assignment you are asked to submit a map or model that outlines the borders and/or paths of your proposed world.

There are no limits to this assignment: your map may be drawn by hand or on a computer; your model can be built out of things you have at hand: Lego bricks, paper, popsicle sticks, furniture, etc. Get creative and don’t hesitate to use uncommon materials.

In your map or model you must:

  * show how a character can navigate through the space. You may use arrows, signs, labels, or color coding to identify paths, or find some other way to identify how a player can move through the world.
  * keep it simple and minimal; almost abstract if you want. Do not use color or lighting except for labels. Make it your “grey box”. You’ll have an opportunity to add color and ambiance in the next assignment.

Upload at least one photo of your map or model only. There are 4 additional spaces to upload media, if you wish, but these are optional. Use captions to describe and highlight what you are sharing with your peers.

Additionally, write a short paragraph that gives your peers some information about your proposed world and justifies the decisions you've made in your map or model. I highly recommend reading the Tips for Completion section below for this part of the assignment. Note: to help your peers, this paragraph is uploaded first.

 
### example
Brimstone Cove is a fictional american town on the shores of New England in Sorenshaw County. It's a fairly small community: a short main street, few shops with friendly tenants, a marina of swaying fishing boats, a wooden white and blue church and a cemetery facing the ocean. On the outskirts, a slightly menacing and grim old colonial mansion stands. Beside the ocean's view, the town is bordered by a forest, some crop fields and a muggy swamp. The weather is mostly overcast with some occasional light shafts piercing the clouds. Sometimes an ominous fog takes over. During evenings though, occasionally, stars shine bright while the sky clears out.

The game begins with the main character, Lyndon, making a big discovery in the barn at his family’s farm. This sets off a series of events that leads Lyndon to meet with his friends, Thaddeus and Callista (who are also playable characters in the game) into Brimstone Cove and further thrilling mysteries.

The game is non-linear: the characters can move back and forth between any level of the game at any point. Each character navigates the world on foot. The placement of the locations is logical: adjacent locations mimic how they might appear in the real world, ie. from farm to field to forest to town. But there are secret short cuts in specific moments in the game. Also, the player has the ability to teleport between locations they have already visited. 

The maps below presents visualizations of the entire world of the game. 
The [first](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/level-design.jpeg) is drawn by hand, which would be fine for this week's assignment.
I'm also sharing with you [two](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/1.png) [views](https://github.com/CN3ves/Games/blob/master/GameDesignArtConcepts/3%20-%20World%20Design%20for%20Video%20Games/3.png) of the same map rendered in Unity.
