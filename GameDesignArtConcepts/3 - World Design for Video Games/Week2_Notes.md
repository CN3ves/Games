### Don't create from the void

How do we begin creating a video game world?
Well, first of all, we will have to explore other medias.
Looking into films, books, paintings, art, movement, your own backyard maybe,
and you think that appeals to you that triggers something in your brain.
It is really fundamental to look at other art practices
when you start creating video games.
You don't create from a void, obviously.
Video games share many aspects of other arts.
They offer a sythesis of multiple practices and they benefit from their
various efforts.
Although they quite dramatically different from cinema, literature, theater, comic books,
they are drawing from all these practices.

Then, artists always look at other artists.
Fumito Ueda, for example, who is Japanese game designer, creator of Ico
and Shadow of Colossus, was really inspired by a Neo-Baroque surrealist artist, Giorgio de Chirico.
And even though de Chirico is really influential for Fumito Ueda,
Fumito Ueda also developed his own visual aesthetic, his own visual world,
ambiance, and atmosphere.

There's always constant appropriation and legacy,
this artistic legacy, in term of video game content.

All these video games that are now contemporary - created with new video game engines - are
now modern games, but with old school visual style, that we have actually
defined because of limitation that we have now using visual purposes.
Well, all this constant reappropriation in video games
exists too in the video game format itself.

Visual artists work in a broad variety of ways.
Someone like Moebius, for example, a French comic book artist, who's a really
famous comic book artist and painter, also works in the movie industry and
became really influential in some really famous Hollywood movies in the 80s,
as well as working in video games.
So if you're an artist, and you look at other practices,
it's also the case when you work, let's say as a comic book artist.
You might also want to expand that and bring it to video game.
And obviously the way you do it might be quite tricky.
And that's where we're going.

Another thing too that may be really important when you start defining your video game world
  * You can look at dance, and other physical art.Sports, the way you move.
  * Think about the sound too, how the game will sound, not just the music. 
  * Think about how the world must sound like.
Birds in the trees, wind in the meadow, swords clanging, rockets flying.
Think about the ambiance, the atmospheric sounds when you're
actually just not doing anything in the game at all.
The world is still living and moving and advancing maybe.
  * Think of textures, consistency.
And everything you touch as a play aspect, play object.
That's really important to stress that play aspect.
Think about everything you can play with outside video games.

Think of that game.A recent game.
Tear Away is all about this paper world.
Everything in the game seems made of paper, and for a good reason, it's because
everything made in that game was done in paper, in real life concrete paper.
The fact that the developers made this, it translates perfectly in the game.
You can feel that playful aspect of playing with paper when you play the game.
All the game play characteristics and content and
visual aspects of the game are transparent in that matter.

Look at things that have very mundane, repetitive practices around you.
Look at what triggers attention in your surroundings.
Again, play with everything.
Shuffle objects, properties and functions.
Change the qualities, that is what video game design is all about in the end.

### Aesthetics & Gameplay

Now let's talk about aesthetic and gameplay.
Two sides of the same coin, basically.
Things that are going all the way together in video game design.

So how do you make your gameplay and your aesthetic really complimentary?
Well, when the world is gameplay itself, like in Limbo.
In Limbo, the whole world is in black and white, everything you see is really
minimal, is really creepy, scary and terrifying. That's the purpose of it.
You never really know if you're gonna get close to something,
if it's not gonna be the leg of a giant spider, who will just kill you right away.
It's tricky because it tricks your eyes and tricks you in terms of gameplay.

Well then, you can also think about games where the world is color coded.
Another example, like in Mirror's Edge.
In Mirror's Edge you play in the first person and
you do this sort of parkour on top of buildings.
The aesthetic was praised at the time for it's really minimal, clear, and
clean aesthetic.
And, one thing in Mirror's Edge is that everything you could do,
everything you knew you could interact with, had different color.
Everything was becoming pure red and white.
Something that is actually creating not only an interesting
gameplay idea of trying to find your way, not by throwing giant arrows, but
just by looking at the colors in the world.
But also really distinct, a really unique aesthetic.

Then again, if we think about Tear Away and
the way it feels, the ways it looks, the paper properties in Tear Away.
How you can use different papers, different texture and materials.
And now you can try to emulate that and see that in the game.

Video games are tactile.
No matter how you think about it.
Not only because you touch a screen.
They're tactile because there's a feedback.
You're to think about how you interact with the world.
If you give the world a look where it's clay,
wool, you have to think about how you can use these properties in the gameplay.
If it's all in clay, will you be able to remodel, to change, and
use this clay property?

And then, give a really distinct look to your game is really important.
As important as giving it, a unique feel.
It's the case with Katamari Damacy game by Keita Takahashi.
In Katamari Damacy you're rolling this giant ball that is gathering,
sticking with a lot of objects, items, people, houses, then planets.
And this ball created by keeping and combining
all these aspects and objects, is really happening, there's a feel to it.
The way the controler is used, by pressing the analog sticks to forward -
You would push this ball with your hands.
also plays a really important part in Katamari Damacy and the way you feel,
moving, rolling actually in that world.
And if everything looks chaotic and seemingly really unordered, everything is
actually really simple and really clear, really visually perfectly defined.

### Clockworks

Now let's think about the inner mechanics of the world.
What itâ€™s like - all the gears, running around, running inside that world of yours?
Think about the contrast, the oppositions.
  * Is it going to be you against the world or the world against you?
  * Is it going to be political?
  * Is it going to be factions involved, two different armies,
and what side are you going to be?
  * Are you going to be able to see the side of the opposite, the enemy?

A world lived through time, there's a state of affairs, conflicts.
If it's a brand new world, untouched, are you going to break it?
Are you going to change it in some way, in some intimate way?
That is one of the burdens that you can find in a lot of contemporary games.
Procedurally generated games, all built through algorithms and mathematics.
When you start a game, it's a completely different game every time.

Even though you think about games like that,
there's layers of time and landmarks.
You still need to have maybe places that may be the same through time.
Ancient ruins take cultural legacy in the world,
a world that is living through its legends and myth.
You will have to find maybe points of interest.

A game like Proteus, for
example, which is displaying an entirely new world every time you play it.
An entirely new island, a randomly generated world.
Well even though the world itself, the island is different every time you play
you will still be able to find, and
that's really interesting, some landmarks some places that will still be the same no
matter how the island looks like or is, a cemetery, a giant tree, a tower.
These landmarks will not just be there for visual sights, but will also guide you,
maybe help you find your way in these worlds.
So that's exactly what is anchoring your world down.

### Questions
it's going to be up to you to create and design your own world.
Well, start by asking yourself:
  * where is your world located?
  * What composes it physically?
Is it going to be more water, space, maybe only a desert.
Is it going to be a giant, sprawling megalopolis?
  * Why does it look this way?
Why is it extremely bright or extremely dark and broody?
  * And, obviously, what about its inhabitants?
What lives there, in this world?
Describe the fauna, maybe the flora.
Think about characters you might encounter during your journey.
Think about enemies, creatures, animals, anything that lives there.
  * And think about how your characters will fit in this world.
Is everything going to be against you or is it just
going to be generally hostile world where you will have to hack and slash your way.
Cut through it and conquer that world.
  * If the world is deriving from a myth then
what is lying at the core of your world's existence?
Where does the actual story fit in a much maybe broader context?
Is it going to be, is the actual story going to be the context itself maybe, or
is everything going to be encapsulated like one
self-contained story in one self-contained world?
If you put a strong emphasis on that myth, it means more work, obviously.
But it also means probably much more engaging world
than a world that may be in constant evolution, mutation maybe.
Something that is expanding from the frontiers of the world you're creating.
Something that will leak through it.

One game, one example, is Xenoblade Chronicles.
Well, Xenoblade Chronicles is all about a macro myth.
Basically, the whole story behind is these two gods fighting constantly with each other.
And at some point got stuck.
Just frozen in time in their final stance.
Then, life started to develop up on the back of these giant creatures these
titans.
And the characters you're playing with are literally tiny,
tiny creatures in a giant world, on top of a giant creature.
And then, it's really important to keep all of that consistent all the times.
Because if they're on the back of these creatures,
maybe they are draining energy from the core of this dormant monster.
Maybe they will have to get inside this crater at some point.
Maybe depending on where they are located on the body of the creature,
they will get different visuals, atmosphere, ambiances.
Other type of creatures living there.

If you are in a game, and you are just suddenly swallowed in the belly of
a whale, if you get into a really organic creature.
If you are on a disk on top of elephants that are also on top of a giant turtle
roaming space, well, this world seemed constantly evolving.
Constantly mutating, they're organic, they're living worlds.
And all of this rejoined this aspect of
the metaphoric power that video games can have.
  * Is your world really what it really seems?
Video games have a really strong power of polymorphism.
Anything in video game can be or become something else.
**Stay in focus**, and try to **stay consistent** no matter what.
There's no true or false statement.
Think about it this way, how can you fake it - how can you create
that constant evolution of an organic world, a world that is ever expanding?


### Back to the rulebook
Now let's get back to the rulebook.
  * Think about what drives the player in your game, or in any game.
What can a player do here?
His impact must be felt in various degrees in the world,
like opening doors, activating mechanisms, what kind of contraption
actually is he going to be able to manipulate, activate, change maybe.
  * This haptic feeling, and I am really putting this emphasis on the haptic word,
which means feeling it physically, like having this impact.
  * It's going to be felt, somehow, through the controller feed back, vibrating.
Everything you do vibrates.
When you move some really big stones and your controller is vibrating, you feel it.
You feel the impact you have on the world.
  * Is it going to be just visual cues, sounds, opening a chest,
looting something and getting a joyful, playful music when you discover something?
Well, all of these aspects are like things you feel as you play the game,
as you are experiencing what your character does and
what you're doing through him in the game as a player.

If your role in this world is defined by a set of events shared by others, then
if you are the only remedy to the world's demise, how are you going to feel that?
How is the world going to make you feel and understand that you are the final cure?
Are you going to save it and feel that you are really meaningful upon that world?
That's what a lot of games are trying to make you feel,
and sometimes doing it in a really amazing way.

If you're respecting the myth,
the legend, will a player be forced to play accordingly to that myth?
Will they have the choice to deviate in some ways?
If the story has multiple embranchments, and if somehow you
managed to keep the same ending, how is everything going to get back on track?
Is it also something you can define?
Is it going to be multiple endings?
And if so, well then will you want to play the game again in order to get
a different ending to understand the story through a different point of view?
Previous events that are occurring in that world can dictate how you play and
the actions you can or will undertake.

### Make it yours
Now that world, make it yours.
It's really important.
Even if it's adapted from a non-game environment.
If you're adapting an existing story,
an existing world, well detail then, what is really appealing to you?
  * Is it the world?
  * The characters?
  * The relation they have toward it?
What makes a difference in terms of ambiance?
And, what would make that world different in terms of gameplay,
if you adapted differently?
Maybe if you tweak it, change it.
Or if it's your own world, maybe inspired from what you see around yourself.
What is your interpretation of this world?
What would you retain from the world you might want to adapt?
And if you're adapting something that is already out there.
If the visuals have been defined, if it's a movie, comic book, well,
chances are you can't exactly develop the exact same style, 
even though you would want to. you might want to bring your own ertistry to it,
your own design, your own grain of salt.

Well, **keep what matters the most**.
The context, the story, the characterization.
Really, anything that still works even without any style, design, imagery.
Make the design and the style a choice and not something that depends upon technical limitation only.

### Shuffle your ideas

bring everything you have, put everything on the table and shuffle everything.
see hat connects with what, what fits.
break everything into chunks, the chunks into bit ans the bits into pieces.
having dust of ideas spread all around. and then gather it all around on a board or a wall.

you can still shuffle while you're doing that, you can stillbring things new.
don't scrap anything yet. keep things at hand, you may see them at different light during game development.
When everything looks good, think again. make the connections, detail what triggers what and, if it helps, 
map your thoughts, just do some diagrams.

There are many ways to organize your thoughts around your game world design.
First, take a deep breath and try one of these methods to get your ideas out of your head:
Cut-outs:
  * Write your ideas out on small pieces of paper, like a Post-It. Keep every idea very succinct and textual.
  * Organize your ideas thematically, then use a board to pin them up or sort them into boxes.
  
Create a mood board:
  * Organize and display visual inspirations, like a physical Pinterest board or Tumblr.
  * Cut out images and clippings from various sources, like old magazines.

Sketch in a notebook, sketchbook, or digitally:

  * Sketches can then be added to your mood board.

If most of your research is digital:

  * Use Pinterest to organize visuals.
  * Use Evernote for both text and visual.
  * Or, software used to generate business processes or site maps can be used with some success for your own game world maps. Try free, cloud-based options like Coggle or Gliffy.

## Assignement not submitted)

### description
In this assignment you are asked to start creating a visual sketch of a world you want to create, focusing on style, mood and ambience only. The idea here is visual research: don't create from the void; instead, look around you for inspiration.

For the purposes of this assignment you are asked to upload a selection of visual sources that define the genre and context of your world. Find visual sources that help define your worldâ€™s:

  * time period
  * location
  * climate
  * landscape
  * lighting
  * the context, or circumstances that have created this world

Submit a minimum of 4 images, but no more than 10. You are required to include visuals from at least two different sources.

For each image please submit a caption that describes specifically how the image connects to your vision of the world, or why you have chosen it. To help your peers, write any specific details in the image you want to highlight.

You are also asked to write a short paragraph describing your vision for your world, and how the visual elements fit together or connect. This may be very loose or intuitive at this point, but that's okay! Note: to help your peers, this paragraph is uploaded first. 

### Example
Brimstone Cove is conceptualized as a Pixel-art sidescroller adventure game. It is narratively driven and visually minimal. Influences range from LucasArts' classic adventure games from the 90s, such as Maniac Mansion and Days of the Tentacle, to modern games like Silent Hill, Kentucky Route Zero and a tiny bit of Sword and Sorcery. A major inspiration also comes from the Japanese videogame series Mother (EarthBound).

The visual style and writing is a take on classic American horror and atmospheric tales, from Edgar Allen Poe to Stephen King to Ray Bradbury. There's definitely Lovecraftian inspiration at its core. John Carpenter and George Romero also have influenced this project, as well as Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and David Lynch's Twin Peaks. Intentions are to use tropes in a "classic" set-up and try to slightly alter what we know or expect. Although based on horror literature it is not a horror game. Brimstone Cove is colorful while also quite mellow and nostalgic. The story is filled with humor, comedy and cheerful moments. This coming-to-age tale is filled with foul demons, an East Coast vibe, anachronistic TV references, love, and occasionally: pizza.
