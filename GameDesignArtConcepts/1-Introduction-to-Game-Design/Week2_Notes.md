# Week 2: Rules and Discovery
How does a player learn the mechanics of your game? How do they learn anything about your game? This week we will talk about the rules that define gameplay, and how those rules are communicated to your players. We also discuss the way rules are bent and broken by players.

## Introduction to rules

A design document, it has no standard format, but it has a standard purpose.
It communicates your game, and your homework did just that.
Calling something a game, and thinking of something as a game keeps it fun.
Thinking creatively is much easier when we're at ease and enjoying our time.
It's important while we create, that we should be having fun and
playing with our ideas.

For this week, we'll be talking about making rules for your game.
We'll be looking at some examples of how rules are used in gaming, and
we'll try to understand how small changes in your rules can have a big effect
on how your players interact with your game.

## Balance

Let's talk about how a video game's rules can help your game achieve a balance
that keeps your players interested and engaged.

You probably remember a time when you've solved the game,
then replayed an earlier level that you once thought was really hard,
only to find that the level is now not so much of a challenge.
Well, this has happened to most game designers, too.
They know that their games need to be challenging enough to keep you interested,
but not so challenging that you become disheartened and give up.
The game designer tries their best to keep things balanced.
Just as the levels get more difficult, your character might discover a new
power that will help them overcome these new obstacles.
And if that power starts making things too easy,
the designer needs to make some obstacles even more difficult.
You can see how this becomes a cycle that repeats throughout a lot of games and
how that cycle can keep a player interested in gaining a better power
in order to solve a new problem, in order to gain an even better power,
in order to solve an even tougher obstacle, and so on.

Where else can we find balance in the rules of games?
Well, a lot of the rules that we see repeated in a lot of games
are repeated because there's balance to them, and that keeps things interesting.
  * Lots of games have some sort of game mechanic that involves the character's health points or lives.
If a character has a ton of health, the player might take more risks. Those risks will cause them to lose some of their health, which will make them more cautious and they'll take less risks, which will help them maintain their health. There's some balance to that, and
it keeps things interesting as a player plays the game one way when their
character is healthy and another when their character is unhealthy.
  * Most of the really good power-ups in video games have at least one big disadvantage. They could provide invulnerability for a limited time and in limited amounts. They could be really powerful but rare, expensive or slower.
These rules, with their trade-offs, help to keep the game challenging.
Even though the character might gain more powers, they still need to learn how to
use them and work with the quirks and imperfections of those new powers.
So keep in mind as you make rules for your games: 
  * Will they keep the game interesting and challenging for a player?
  * Will they make things too easy or difficult?
  * Will they give your player a new goal to reach for or help create a new challenge?
  * Will they force your players to think of new approaches and techniques for playing?
Keeping your game balanced is one of the biggest challenges you have as a game
designer, but one that pays off many times over for you and your players.

## What are rules

When we play a board game, one of the first things we do is read the rules.
If we didn't know and understand the rules of the game, we wouldn't know if
someone was cheating, or even what the goal of the game might be.
In video games, most people start playing a game without reading any instructions,
and they discover the rules by exploring the game and trying out different actions.
They don't need to know the rules, because the game acts as a referee.
It knows all the rules and
makes sure that none of them are broken as the player explores the game's world.

A rule is anything that defines what happens in
the game and isn't a player's input.
There might be a rule that says the character can jump five feet.
Another might say, the character cannot walk through walls.
That's an obvious rule, but it's one that a designer would need to define.
Anything that needs to happen, or
needs to not happen, will have to be explained in a rule.
And that can be a lot of rules.
  * World's rules define the game's world, the way it works, what it looks like and how a player might interact with the objects in that world. They help keep the objects in the world organized in a way that
makes sense to the player. Other rules are there to make the game more interesting for the players.
  * Gameplay rules define a game, how it is played and the way it's won or lost. In more complicated games, the gameplay rules may also help explain the narrative aspects of the game and
lay out the various goals a player needs to achieve to complete your game.

The reason to break up rules into two categories is to help  organize rules in
my project. Most games will need a lot of rules so it pays to stay organized.
There are different ways of organizing and
describing rules among different game designer, different game companies,
and even in the same company with different games.
The important thing is not that you choose to organize your rules in this exact way,
but that you organize them in a way that is clear to you and your collaborators,
and in a way that makes sense for your game.

Why does your game need rules?

  * Rules help a computer understand human concepts, like how to serve a ping pong ball.
  * Rules help define the goals of a game.
  * Rules help define the limitations of a game's world - such as rules that describe which objects a character can and cannot walk through.


## Breaking the rules

You can't change the rules halfway through a card game,
but you can change the rules half way through a video game.

When designing a game, you can change the rules whenever you feel like the current
set of rules are becoming too predictable.
Usually, unless you want to confuse your players,
which is a possibility, it's best to let them know why you've changed the rules,
and provide some reason seen by the player.
  * They stepped on a trap and that reversed gravity
  * They dropped their gun and it broke, which is what caused it to start shooting in the wrong direction.


Changing or adjusting the rules can keep your game interesting and unpredictable.
There are also simpler reasons why you might want to change the rules of your
game from time to time, for more structural and narrative reasons.
  * Disabling attacks for conversation sequences where it might produce unwanted story results.
  * Disable sneaky skills and stealing from a store if it might make the game too easy.

These sorts of rule changes are used to keep the game
at a right level of difficulty and they're also used to simplify programming and
keep the designer from having to create parts of the game that aren't needed for
their intended story.

As a game designer, you set the rules and you break them, too.
Just keep in mind, when the rules change, so will your game play.
Keep in mind that this may affect your game.
  * Will it bring interesting variety?
  * Will it simplify the programming?
  * Will it have positive effects, without confusing or frustrating the player in unintended ways?

What purposes can be served by changing the rules in your game?
  * You can make the game more difficult for your players.
  * You can have different rules for different areas of your game that need different types of gameplay.
  * You can make the game more surprising for your players.

## Learning the rules

How do your players figure out the rules for your game? 
Are they reading instructions or using trial and error?
Like most things in video game design, a well thought out plan for
how your players will discover your rules can help your game more enjoyable and
interesting for everyone who picks it up.

  * Documentation: Some rare players might want to read instructions for your game, but
 they are the exception to the rule. Most players will not look in the box for a manual or search for
 it online before they start up your game and give it a try. Though some manuals are well designed and some can contain interesting tips, illustrations and extras, few are read, and
 games should make sense to a player who is only learning the game by playing it.
 This isn't to say that your players won't be doing any reading in the game.
 Lots of games have *in-game documentation*.
 These are rarely get longer than a few sentences, such as a screen pop-up with some text that explains the rules of gameplay or some item in your inventory.
 Try to keep this sort of documentation clear and brief when it's used.
 Every time your player has to stop playing to read instructions,
 it takes them out of the game a little bit.
 
  * Narration: One step up from documentation is narration.
 Instead of giving us text to read,  some games choose to give us audio narration to guide us through gameplay. The nice part about this method is it can often happen in the background as a player
 continues to explore. Just make sure that your narration isn't redundant.
 If narration is used well, it can be integrated into your story and
 it can tell the player things they would have no other way of knowing.
 Sometimes a game might turn the narration into a character in itself.
 Even if the narration comes from characters that are rarely seen, but
 the narration itself always has unique personality,
 the player feels like they're listening to a character and experiencing the game,
 rather than listening to an instruction book.
 
 * In-Game Discovery: There is an old rule in writing: Show, don't tell. 
 What it means is that, when possible, a player should be experiencing the story 
 with all their senses rather than just being told things.
 My friend and I have worked out a little example here.
 The tell version is a lot less interesting, exciting, and
 memorable than the show version.
 Whenever possible, try to let your players discover the rules by experiencing them.
 They can explore their abilities in an environment where initial mistakes won't
 result in their immediate death.
 And they can get to understand the rules before moving on to the tough stuff.
