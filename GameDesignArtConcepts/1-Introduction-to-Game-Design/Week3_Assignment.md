## Description

We're going to take our games and think about adding to their story.
Is there a way you can get your audience even more
involved with your game, using a little story?

If there is a story already, is there a way you can improve it?
  
  * What is my story? If you start off with a game with just a simple path, but
in one version you're running from monsters, and
in another you're competing in an auto race, each one of those stories will
lead to different problems and solutions as you make your game.
  * What is my story doing to affect my game?
  * What is my story doing to affect my character?
  * Does the story change the way a player might act?
For instance, if I make a game and the main character's a werewolf,
would that change my player reacted to pictures of full moons and silver bullets?
  * Are the players discovering things as they go through your game?
Meaning what do they learn at the start, the middle, and at the end of your game?
What are they learning about the world and the challenges along the way?
  * Are there parts of your story that can be removed without changing your story?
If there's something that if you were to remove it,
your game still feels just as good, maybe you should remove it.

Remember, every element you add, is another thing that has to be designed,
programmed and tested.Simplicity can really help.

If you show your game to a friend, and
then ask them to tell the story back to you, what do they say?
That one can be really helpful,
since your game might not be communicating what you think.
Sometimes you can be really surprised when you find out your game is communicating
something totally different than what you intended.

## Assignment 

Create narrative elements for your game - either adding to your previous assignment or creating a new one. These elements should add to your player's experience by affecting their progress through your game, the visuals of your game, the gameplay, or any other ways you might devise.
Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions

Take the previous iteration of your game from Week 2 and build a story into it, or create a new game based around a story that inspires you. The goal of this assignment is to incorporate narrative elements into your game to make the gameplay more compelling and enjoyable. You will be evaluated on your understanding of the various strategies of incorporating narrative into your game through an accompanying statement. As before, you must keep the following limitations in mind:

  * The game should all fit on one piece of paper, ideally letter-sized or A4 so people can print it out, if they wish.
  * The game should be a one-player game.
  * A short description and instructions for your game should be at the top of the page.
  * The only extra thing anyone should need to play are two six-sided dice, which are an optional element you may include in your game. (If you don’t have dice, there are websites that can simulate dice rolls, such as https://www.random.org/dice.)

You can draw your game by hand, or create it on your computer. Scan it and save it as a PDF. Be sure the image is legible for your peer reviewers! Don’t forget to include a title for your game.

Additionally, to give your peers some context, please include two statements that respond to the following questions:

  * From the previous assignment, what peer feedback did you find the most useful, and how did you incorporate it into your game, if at all?
  * Describe the narrative elements you have added to this version of your game. Is your game writer-driven, writer-led, or player-led? What elements in the game support the approach you have used?


## Game

1. Give your peer reviewers some context. Describe the narrative elements you have added to this game. Is your game writer-driven, writer-led, or player-led? What elements in the game support the approach you have used?  

For this part of the game, I tried to focus on making a writer-led game, in which the player is given a number of logical choices to pick from, based on his/hers experiences/preferences. I have attempted to move from learning the rules by documentation to in-game discovery (assuming the player does not cheap and reads beforehand, the outcomes are only known after the choice is made). As a result, I have though about a text-based game, where the player has a set of defined choices which may differ depending on how he/she happens to navigate the temple maze. Even though limited, it is intended that the player choices will drive the story and ultimately define what happens "in the world". One final change reflects the introduction of narrative elements, with the game being narrated in the "first person", aiming to create more empathy with the character and the story.

The resulting game can be found [here](https://github.com/CN3ves/GameDesign-Art-Concepts/blob/master/1-Introduction-to-Game-Design/Week3_StoryBased.pdf)

## Comments

What is, in your opinion, the strongest or most exciting thing about the story of their game? Do the narrative elements make the game more enjoyable? Are the narrative elements clear and evocative?

  1. I really like the fact that your try to make some danger in this game!! It is really cool and imersive.
  2. The story is interesting and has details and many narrative elements Thank you for the interesting game
  3. I loved your text-based game. 
	-The narrative for the game was extremely well thought.
	-I thought the game had a very unifying theme. 
	-The possible length of the game play was very appropriate. 
	-Because of the several possible actions, a player could make on this game, it never seemed monotonous or dull.

What is one thing the student can do to improve how the story is presented in their game? What could they do to make the story clearer, or improve how it unfolds over the course of the game? What changes to the story would make the game more exciting for you?

  1. Because you make a chart, it is diffucult to see a story that is fluid and the links. Maybe you can be more concise ;)
  2. Explain how to play more and plot the game so I can imagine more
  3. I thought so much of text reading took a lot of cognitive load. Using at least some visual elements in the game would have helped reduce this cognitive load on the player and encouraged him/her to play more. Nevertheless, the game sounds like a classic.
