## Description

Let's put together a game that can use another character,
either a second human player or some sort of non-player character.
You can try to incorporate something like this into your current project, or
you can create a totally new game using all the things we've learned so far.
Here's two approaches you might try.
  * Can you expand your current game into a two player game?
  * Is it something that two people can take turns playing?
  * Is it something that two people can play at the same time?
  * Can they play cooperatively against a common challenge?
  * Would it be more fun if they played against each other?
This can be something as simple as changing a space that used to say
move ahead one space to other player moves ahead one space or
other player moves back to the start or other players are sent to Mars.

  * Can you add a second player that could be automatically controlled like an NPC?
  * Can an NPC be added to your game?
It could be something as simple as a character that won't let your players
pass until they roll a three or answer a riddle.
It could be a wolf that automatically moves one space ahead each turn,
always chasing your players through a snowy world.

Remember that an NPC can add to your environment and
they can also add challenges to your game.
So that's all for this week and this class.


## Assignment 
Add a second player to your game, or create a new multi-character game. You can make a two-player game or add a non-player character (NPC).
Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions

Take the previous iteration of your game from Week 3 and add a PC or NPC, or create a new multi-character game. The goal of this assignment is to make the game playable by more than one character. Think about the various strategies of incorporating multiple characters - PCs and NPCs - into your game and how you can maintain balance between players. As before, you must keep the following limitations in mind:

  * The game should all fit on one piece of paper, ideally letter-sized or A4 so people can print it out, if they wish.
  * A short description and instructions for your game should be at the top of the page.
  * The only extra thing anyone should need to play are two six-sided dice. If you don’t have dice, there are websites that can simulate dice rolls, such as https://www.random.org/dice.

You can draw your game by hand, or create it on your computer. Scan it and save it as a PDF. Be sure the image is legible for your peer reviewers! Don’t forget to include a title for your game.

Additionally, to give your peers some context, please include two statements that respond to the following questions:

  * From the previous assignment, what peer feedback did you find the most useful, and how did you incorporate it into this game, if at all?
  * Describe the approach you have taken in adding multiple characters to your game. Have you added PCs or NPCs? What strategies did you use to maintain balance between the players in your game, or make your game more exciting?


## Game

1. From the previous assignment, what peer feedback did you find the most useful, and how did you incorporate it into your game? Specifically, how have you used peer feedback to improve your game design? Be descriptive!

Most of the positive feedback focused on the story and how the narrative elements works well together. This time, I aimed at adding more narrative elements through NPCs (girl, hunter, etc.) and through an optional opposing character, while leaving the relationships as open ended questions for the player's imagination (or as potential narrative material for a "future chapter" - revisiting existing character as suggested in the lessons).

Most negative comments were related to the information density in the previous game as, being text-based, it didn't have much visual support.

For this game, I continue with the story-line of the previous games. As week 3 already had some NPC characters and it would be complex to fit a text-based multi-player in a one-page game, I decided to move back to the board-game style. However, the random hexagonal grid game-play would make the rules for an NPC too complex and I simplified the board (inspired by other interesting student games). This allowed me to try:
  * adding more visuals
  * adding passive NPCs (girl, hunter, ghost, knights)
  * adding active NPC ( the beats moved on the board and "plays automatically"
  * adding a second optional PC

I fell the game is simpler, but still complex, while adding a new complete layer of characters to the narrative.
The resulting game can be founf [here](https://github.com/CN3ves/GameDesign-Art-Concepts/blob/master/1-Introduction-to-Game-Design/Week4_players.pdf).

2. Describe the approach you have taken in adding multiple characters to your game. Have you added PCs or NPCs? What strategies did you use to maintain balance between the characters in your game, or make your game more exciting?  


For this submission I tried to add a bit of everything as a challenge. I kept the two NPCs from the previous submission (the beast and the ghost) but made the beast an active player, running towards the village to oppose the protagonist in a time dependent doom. I added two other passive NPCs (the lost girl and the hunter) but left their relationship left to explain, creating some helpful characters that can be revisited at later stages (note there is some opposition as helping one, prevents helping the other). Finally, to try out multi-player options, I added a optional PC who mysteriously opposes the main protagonist.
  * The optional character as the advantage of starting closer to the end point of the main protagonist (who he has to intercept). In addition, he does not have to pass the difficult roll 6. To balance these advantages, I consider making this character move slower and having a similar challenge/difficulty to win as the main player (roll 5-6).
  * The other character that needed balancing was the beast. It's movement is constant and limited to 2 per turn, so it doesn't run thought the board in its path of destruction. In addition, because the challenge of rolling 6 to access the village, the main player is encouraged to find either the hunter or the lost girl. This means it is going to take some time doing these "side quests" and I added two ways to counter the beast unstoppable rampage: the knights and the ghost. The ghost is a type of "ultimate brake", rendering the beast weak and allowing the main player to focus on the optional player, balancing (at random) the two "villains".

These rules made the game more complex, but hopefully more strategic, more exciting and more balanced. 


## Comments
What is, in your opinion, the strongest or most exciting thing about this version of their game? Is this a game you want to play again?
  
  1. I love the intensity of your story. The intensity of the story makes me empathize with the character and play the game.
  2. I really like the narration!! 
  3. A good game and its rules are complex and balanced thanks to you
  
What is one thing the student can do to improve the player(s) experience in the game?

  1. While playing the game, I found that helping the hunter or the girl, puts the player at a significant disadvantage in the current game. The beast is highly likely to cross or get ahead of the player while the player is doing the side-task.
  2. Maybe adding more narration in link with the rules? 
  3. There is a strong barrier to the village how to overcome it
