## Description

This week, our assignment will be to make a simple game on paper.

There are only a few requirements.
 * The game should all fit on one piece of paper.
 * The game should be a one player game.
 * A short description and instructions for your game should be at the top of the page.
 * The only extra thing anyone should need to play are two six-sided dice. If you don't have dice, there are websites that can simulate dice rolls.

Even though there are a lot of limitations with this assignment,
there's also a lot you can do inside those limitations.
Here's some ideas.
 * The game space can be any shape or design so long as it fits on a sheet of paper.
 * You might have a player moving along a straight path or a winding path, or a straight path with branches, or a winding path with branches. Or a maze or a grid or any design that will fit on the page so long as it makes sense in the context of your game.
 * The spaces on your game board can say anything or at least anything that will fit into that small space. A space might change your characters goal or the number of dice they roll each turn. Or it might unlock a new part of your board or have a space that makes my player move backwards?

I think it's important in this class that you learn some things from the course
and some things from yourself.

The things we went over, whether you're game should be a twisty path or
a grid, or a maze, what the spaces on your path should say,
that might all sound like a lot to fit on one page and that's true.
You won't be able to do that all on one game.
One of the reasons we're limiting ourselves to a one page assignment
is to keep our game simple and manageable.
Your game might only have space for one or two unusual features, and that's fine.
It's better for a game to have one or
two unusual features that you've had time to develop
than to have your game have many features that aren't thought out or are confusing.

For this assignment we're going to be focusing on game play rather than art work.
You can always take time to make your game look fancier or more polished but
if the game play is boring, that fancy artwork won't matter.
As you design your game, remember to test it out.
See what it feels like to play the game, maybe even get some friends to try it out.

## Assignment 
In this very first assignment we will start with the basics: create a simple game on a sheet of paper. This game could form the basis for future assignments in this class; you may continue to build your game and expand on it in future weeks, or you may choose to develop new games as you grow. But for now, keep it simple!

Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions

This week you are asked to make a simple game on a single sheet of paper. Your game should include:

  * A clearly articulated goal, and
  * A degree of difficulty enhanced by chance and/or skill.

Additionally, you must keep the following limitations in mind:

  * The game should all fit on one piece of paper, ideally letter-sized or A4 so people can print it out, if they wish.
  * The game should be a one-player game.
  * A short description and instructions for your game should be at the top of the page.
  * The only extra thing anyone should need to play are two six-sided dice, which are an optional element you may include in your game. (If you don’t have dice, there are websites that can simulate dice rolls, such as https://www.random.org/dice .)

Even though there are a lot of limitations for this assignment, there’s plenty you can do within those limitations. (Hint: review the previous video for some ideas.)

You can draw your game by hand, or create it on your computer. Scan it and save it as a PDF. Be sure the image is legible for your peer reviewers!

Don’t forget to include a title for your game, and submit!

## Game
The concept of the game was a simple one: move from A to B to win. To make it interesting, I decided to  randomise the movement, so the player would have to use his skills in response to chance. Having up to two dice, I decided that one would determine the direction and one the movement. This makes a hexagonal grid a perfect board for the game, as to match the six-die rolls with the directions. Since the player can just roll and re-roll until he reaches the goal, I added a penalty. Originally, the payer would lose if he crossed a hexagon twice, but play-testing proved this would be too difficult, and could ruin the fun by being so challenging. Another potential problem was the corners, as the player would not be able to move all the roll value. I introduced the "secret passages" to allow the player to move (at the expense of complicating the rules). With the game-play defined, I added a layer of story. The player wants to get somewhere; *why?* to get something; *what?* a relic, so he could be exploring a temple; *Why?* because he needs the relic to save someone; *who and from what?* generalise to a plague in a realm; *How does the game-play match the story?* The temple is trapped and the player needs to move carefully.
This was the [result](https://github.com/CN3ves/GameDesign-Art-Concepts/blob/master/1-Introduction-to-Game-Design/Week1_SimpleGame.pdf)

## Comments
What is, in your opinion, the strongest or most exciting thing about their game? 

 1. A good game but I do not like mentioning God in such games
 2. I love the hexagons and the concept of moving within them to reach a goal.  You did a great job explaining the game, and I really appreciated having the example to follow.  The idea is simple, but interesting, and your graphics were great.  This is very well thought out. 
 3. You did use two pages, but I gave you a 4 on the top anyway. Your game looks interesting and you have described the rules in great detail. The randomness of direction makes it work. I like the addition of the explanation of the directions with examples.

What is one thing the student can do to improve their game? Do you have a suggestion to make the game more interesting or exciting? Or can you suggest some ways your peer can adjust the design or language in their game to articulate the instructions or goal more clearly?

  2. I would mention that there is an example on the next page.  I spent some time trying to figure out each step, but the example when I scrolled down made it much more clear.  Also, on step 6, articulate what you are supposed to do with the one die roll.  The example makes it clear, but the instructions just say to roll one die, but they do not tell you what you are supposed to do with that number.  In the next iteration of the game, you might want to add more skill since this is mostly chance right now.  Very nicely done!  Great job!  Graphics are terrific!
  3. If there is some way you can make the player move around the occupied ring? That would add some complexity. Also, you might want to use a marker instead of a pencil. Replay without reprinting.

  3. Otherwise this looks like a great start.
