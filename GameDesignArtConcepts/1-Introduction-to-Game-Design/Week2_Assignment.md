## Description

For this week, I'd like you to take a look at your game and
really start thinking about how changes and
adjustments to your rules can make it more engaging, interesting, and fun.
Here's some questions you can ask yourself as you're working, or
if you feel that you're running into problems.

 * What are the rules for my game?
 * In what ways can I change my rules to make my game play differently?
For instance, if your player uses dice to figure out how many spaces they move,
how would it change the game if they only moved on odd numbered rolls.
What would happen if, when ever they rolled a six, they went back to the start?
Remember to try out your game, as you adjust it.

Another question to ask yourself might be, are my rules balanced?
For instance, if half my spaces say skip ahead six spaces,
the game might be over too quickly.
If half tell you to move back six spaces, you'll never get to the end.
What happens if you adjust your rules?
And how does that change the balance of your game?

## Assignment 

This week you are asked to submit a revision of the game you submitted last week to make the rules more balanced and to articulate those rules more clearly to your player. Or start a new game keeping balanced rules in mind.

Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions

Return to the one-page game you submitted for last week’s assignment, or if you prefer, try out a totally new game. The goal of this assignment is to consider the peer feedback you received from you received from last week's game, and and think about how you might use what you've learned to improve your next game. How can you articulate the world or gameplay rules more clearly, and/or balance the rules to make your game more interesting and playable?

As before, you must keep the following limitations in mind:

  * The game should all fit on one piece of paper, ideally letter-sized or A4 so people can print it out, if they wish.
  * The game should be a one-player game.
  * A short description and instructions for your game should be at the top of the page.
  * The only extra thing anyone should need to play are two six-sided dice, which are an optional element you may include in your game. (If you don’t have dice, there are websites that can simulate dice rolls, such as https://www.random.org/dice.)

You can draw your game by hand, or create it on your computer. Scan it and save it as a PDF. Be sure the image is legible for your peer reviewers! Don’t forget to include a title for your game.

Additionally, to give your peers some context, please include two statements that respond to the following questions:

  * From the previous assignment, what peer feedback did you find the most useful, and how did you incorporate it into your new game?
  * Describe how you articulated the world or gameplay rules in this game. Specifically, have you used documentation, narration, or in-game discovery? How has your approach to game rules, instructions, or gameplay enhanced balance or engagement in your game?



## Game

1. From the previous assignment, what peer feedback did you find the most useful, and how did you use this knowledge into your new game? Specifically, how have you used peer feedback to improve your game design? Be descriptive!

There were two main comments from the previous game:
* add more skill and less randomness and
* move around the occupied hex.
I have tried to use these comments to change the game-play by changing the movement rules. Instead of using one roll to select the direction and one to select the distance, I allow the player now to move around the current hex by choosing only the direction and move one space at a time. This results in more flexibility for the player and more control, addressing both comments. It also unbalances the game :)

So, by changing one rule, I had to adapt:
**1)** Forcing the player to move both dice would, on average, keeping him/her moving in circles, which is frustrating. Picking only one would make it far too easy. So I introduced a negative effect for the roll not selected: falling floors as the temple crumbles.
**2)** This new rule, on the other hand, required lifting the "no going back to the same hex" rule (previously added simply for challenge) as it would block 2 hexs per turn and the player would run out of choices very quickly!
**3)** Allowing the player to return to previous hex made it less challenging (just pick the rolls that go in the right direction and cross the hexs on the other way) to reach one exit, so I introduced the "blocked exit rule" to force the player to go in both directions. This way, the player needs to plan moving in both directions and can't use a "one-direction cheat".
The resulting game can be found [here](https://github.com/CN3ves/GameDesign-Art-Concepts/blob/master/1-Introduction-to-Game-Design/Week2_RulesChange.pdf)

2. Describe how you articulated the rules in your game. Specifically, have you used documentation, narration, or in-game discovery? Using your previous game as a point of comparison, how has your approach to game rules, instructions, or gameplay improved the balance or interest in this week's assignment?
The rules of the game where articulated using documentation as before. Being a one-page "board" game, it is very difficult to introduce rules through narration, even though I kept the setting tied to the rules (crossed hex is collapsed floor), so there is a bit of narration. In-game discovery is nearly impossible for a one-player game, as the player is the judge and thus needs to know the rules a priori. I would love to hear other peoples ideas on this!

I think the game is more complex and more exciting with the new rules. The game-play fits nicely with the setting and the player gets more control of his/her actions. It is still difficult to finish without any penalty points, but there is no way of losing (can always fall through it with infinite penalty points...), which I feel is positive for a non-competitive, one player and quick game. I find it difficult to know if the rules are more balanced (mathematically/probabilistically speaking), but I think they are balanced and it feels more natural, so these were definitively some positive changes to the game. 




## Comments

What is, in your opinion, the strongest or most exciting thing about how they have used the rules to achieve balance or interest in their game?

  1. I think the game is a bit complicated but interesting at the same time
  2. The rules have made the game much more randomized. This is the most exciting part about it, though it also made it very complicated to understand.
  3. I really like the fact that this game is enhance with chance. And it seems a little tactical .

What is one thing the student can do to improve balance in the rules of their game, or articulate the rules more clearly or in more interesting ways?

  1. I think the game is professional and I do not have any modification
  2. You should make the rules a little less complex so that the average player can also understand it better. Otherwise the whole idea was amazingly implemented and the story line is also fascinating.
  3. The example is a little difficult to understand. It will be cool if you make a link between the history of the temple and the rules.
