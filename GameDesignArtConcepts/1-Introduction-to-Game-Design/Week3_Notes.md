# Week 3: Tell a Story
How does narrative drive a player to start playing your game? Or to finish it? This week we'll look at some of the ways you can make your game more compelling with story, and discuss some of the ways story can drive gameplay forward, or enable a player to make their own way through it. 

## Introduction to story

We'll be talking about: 
  * What a story can do for your games.
  * how a story can make your games more interesting and emotionally involving.
  * how a story can make your games inspiring to a player,
  * how they can inspire you to make better games.

What do we mean when we say story in the context to a game.
In a really broad way, story refers to 
  * Something that is added to your game to give it context.
So it tells us where we are and what we're looking at.
  * It gives us a narrative, it tells us what's happening in our world.

Context for a game can be very simple. For example, a well chosen game title 
can provide the game with some context. 
The player can imagine and relate the game elements to that context, 
using their imagination to expand the world of the game,
outside it's technical limitations.
By giving the player some context or narrative to go with their game,
you're giving them something to think about.
You're telling them that the world of the game extends beyond
the borders of the screen.
You're giving them things to think about, and things to wonder about.
For example, a changed appearance of a character can make the player wonder 
what had happened.

## Story purpose

Now that we know what a story is, let's talk about why we need one in our games.
After all, there are a lot of games that seem to have very minimal stories and
they're quite successful, and a lot of games that have a ton of story and don't do so well.
The weird thing about video games is almost none of it is real.
It's all made up. But we can have strong emotional connections with characters
because of the stories that we have with them.
They've taken us on adventures and we've helped them through some hard times and
some tough levels.
Story is powerful that way.

Let's talk about The Purpose of Story, what it can do for your games, and

  * Communication: A story helps you communicate your game to your self and to other people.
At some point someone is going to ask you about your game.
Usually your story is gonna be the answer to that question.
It's people's introduction to your game.
It's the way to think about your game during production.
It's very, very important that your game can be communicated clearly.
  * Inspiration: Without a story or some context for your game,
it can be very hard to get it started.
That's because without someplace to start, your possibilities are limitless.
That may sound like a good thing, but it can also give you a directionless feeling.
If you need to design a character or a level and your game could be anywhere
in any time period, there is no place for you to start.
However, if you make a clear decision, you have a much easier task ahead of you.
First off, it narrows down your possible decisions tremendously.
You can narrow your focus to a specific time period, a specific location,
in a specific profession.
You won't be distracted by all the other possibilities out there.
You can concentrate on some specific choices.
Ironically, while finding these story elements helps narrow your focus,
it also opens up a ton of material you can potentially use to get ideas for
your project.
You can dig into some old books about your setting,
you can read about spies from that time period, or from that location.
You can look into history books of possible conflicts, and
you can check out historical pictures for inspiring imagery.
All these things can help make your game a richer and more involving experience for
your player, and for yourself.
  * Emotion: What do you want your audience to feel while they're playing your game?
Now we could try to impart these emotions without a story.
We could try to make an audience happy by showing them some happy colors and
playing some happy music.
But it'll be really difficult.
What if they didn't like the colors we like?
What if they didn't like the music we like?
Will be really hard to get a specific emotion from someone
without some kind of story?
Story allows us to show specific things to bring more specific emotions.
In games, we have a huge advantage over other media, we have empathy.
Since a player usually sees themselves as the main character of a game,
if things happen to that character,
the player often feels like these things are happening directly to them.
  * Surprise: When someone plays a game they're usually looking for a combination of two elements.
Things that are expected and things that are surprises.
Surprises get your audience thinking and
thinking keeps them more involved in your game.
A surprise can be set up by the previous story, which sets up expectations you can break with to create a twist that can give your characters a surprise and keep them interested in the game.
  * Motivation.
The story can help explain the purpose of your game to the player.
And it can help lead them through to the thrilling conclusion.
Of course, a player can just be playing for a maximum score or
something that's really not connected to the story but
it can be much more interesting and inspiring to give them a story.
And a reason to struggle their way through a game.
  * Rescue someone,
  * Find some lost treasure 
  * Right a horrible injustice.
The added benefit is that all these challenges and
motivations can help inspire you to create a more interesting game.
And they can give you ideas about the path of your game.
And they can inspire more levels and challenges along the way.

  * Specificity: story and context help to make your game feel specific.
Take a moment to browse through a few online game stores.
There are a lot of games that feel like clones.
Often, what makes them feel generic, is their lack of story.
Maybe they're using imagery that doesn't really have any story or
context or maybe is because they're using imagery so generic that it doesn't help
them set their game apart from any of the other games out there.
With a little story and the context to let your players know where they are,
you can make your game less generic feeling.
It can become a specific unique game.

So in conclusion, story is not absolutely necessary to make a game.
There are games that barely have any story.
You can make a game with no story just as you could make a game with no color,
no sound, or no main character or representational imagery at all.
You can make a very simple game.
But each time you decide to leave out an element of gaming you have
less tools in your toolkit and less ways to get your players interested and
excited about your game.

What is the benefit of narrowing the focus of your game's story?
  * Without focusing your ideas in a specific area, you might be overwhelmed by an infinite number of choices.
  * If you focus on a specific setting for your game, you can use imagery from that setting for inspiration for your game's visual design.
  * If you focus on a specific time period for your game, you can use writing and stories from that time period as inspiration for your game's narrative.

## Who's in charge of your game story?

A lot of game designers probably think that they are.
They're creating the whole story, programming all the elements, and
figuring out all the paths a player might take.
A lot of players probably feel like they are making the decisions and
performing the actions that carry them through the adventure.
So who writes the story of a video game?

Ideally it's a collaboration between the game designer and the player.
Neither person should feel bored during the process.
But the designer needs to accept the player's place
as co-author of their story.

Players want to feel like they are in charge of the direction in the story.
They want to make the storyline their own and
they want to leave a mark on the path of the narrative.
When making your game, there are a few different styles for
how a story develops, and each has its own positive and negative qualities.
I'm going to go over three that I think are the most common ways a player
finds the story in a game.
These can be helpful for troubleshooting your game if you feel like there's
a conflict between the way your players are experiencing your project and
the way you see that experience developing through playtesting.

### Writer-Driven

This is the easiest way as a writer to communicate your story to the audience.
In effect, you take the player out of the equation.
This can be achieved by taking all the decision-making power out
of the hands of the player.
One of the most common ways to do this is with a cutscene.
It happens in other ways as well.
Sometimes a writer gives a player such limited decisions
that they essentially have no meaningful options.

As a player, I'm sure you're aware of some of the disadvantages of this style.
First, it removes your player's sense of control and connection to their character.
They have been controlling this character for hours.
They have developed that great sense of empathy that we talked about earlier.
It's one of the main things we're hoping to create in our audience.
If you take away the player's control,
they feel like they suddenly aren't inside their character anymore.

Worse still, they have to watch somebody else play their character.
And that's the second disadvantage with this narrative style.
The writer controls the main character and makes choices for
the player and not the other way around.
This can be very frustrating for the player, especially if the choices the character makes 
do not fit the way it is being played.

However, even with these obvious disadvantages,
this style gets used all the time, so you're probably wondering why.
Well, there are actually a lot of advantages to this method.

  1. It helps keep your game simple.
By reducing the number of choices for your player,
you're also reducing the number of choices you have to program, write, and animate.
  2. It allows a writer to make choices that are more appropriate for
a game character, but that a player might not make such as actions requiring complicated science knowledge.
  3. it lets the writer tell a lot of story without being interrupted.
Sometimes a story can grow too big to tell
into little chunks spread sporadically throughout the game.
Letting the writer take over for
a while is a way to do a lot of explanation in one big chunk.
  4. Probably one of the most narratively useful reasons
to take control from your players is to force players to make mistakes.
Mistakes are one of the most useful things a main character can do.
A big mistake can change the mood of your story and serve as the turning point for
your whole game.
A mistake can create problems that can be solved by the player, and
players love solving problems.
However, players also have the ability to save and restore their games.
Players wanna make good decisions.
They don't wanna be forced to make bad decisions,
even if it helps you move your story along. 
As an aside,
I think this is why many games use main characters with troubled pasts.
The character can have a history of past mistakes that are catching up on them,
and these can affect the game without making the character feel
like they're messing up. Also, this probably is why games have sidekicks with
questionable decision-making powers. How many times has a sidekick run into a room before you've have
a chance to check it for danger and you've had to
run in after them in order to rescue them from the trouble they're causing?

These methods and many others help to put some of those wonderful mistakes
into the game without forcing a player to make decisions and
taking away their collaborative power in the story.

### Writer-led

At a glance, writer-led might look a lot like writer-driven,
but they're very different approaches to telling your story.
The main goal of the writer-led method is lead your player through your story
by exciting their curiosity, rather than making their choices for them directly. 
YOu can allow the player to take different routes during the game, even if the end point is the same.
The advantages of this method are that it keeps your player
as the main decision-maker for their character.
It also keeps them inside the character for the entire game.

The disadvantages are that it's often more complex and time consuming for
the game designer.
If given enough thought and time, most things that are told in a writer-driven
way could probably be told in a writer-led way.
Leading your audience with their curiosity will be more rewarding for
your players but probably more time consuming for you.
It's a choice you'll need to make as you balance the complexity of your game with
the time and resources you have to put it together.

### Player-led

There's a third way that stories are told with games and
it's something that can make a game much more involving and fun for your audience.
Sometimes a player can make their own stories inside a game,
stories that weren't even intended by the designer.
Sometimes this happens when a player intentionally decides to
mess with the game.
This can also happen when the player makes their own challenges.
There are even games where the majority of the story is made by
players creating their own challenges.

It's difficult to make a game, where the player can create their own story.
But that is all the more reason to test your games as many players as you can.
You never know when a player might find a new and interesting approach to your game.

## Roleplaying & Character Motivation

The game story that works well is written by the game designer and a player.
This is a difficult concept to get used to since often we associate stories
with non-interactive media like movies and books.
Also we often write alone.
The player isn't around to mess with the flow of our story.

It would really helpful if we could write a story with the player helping out.
Playing their part and reminding us of their unique goals and motivations.
This is why I strongly encourage you all to try out role playing games like
Dungeons and Dragons as you work on your stories.
The reason I'm bringing this up is that it's an interesting way to try out
your game.
And a good way to see how a player might react to different situations in
your game.

This is not to say that all players are trying to go against the story of your game.
However, in general gamers are looking for a challenge.
If I was to say that a certain jump is unjumpable,
all the players would try to jump it.
If I was to say that a certain monster was undefeatable,
all the players would try to defeat it.
So the same thing happens when I try to tell an audience,
I know there's a city here, but it's not part of the story.
Continue with my story direction, doing that sort of thing is not
allowing my players to collaborate with my story, it's shutting them out.
The more your story can include the decisions of your players,
the more your players will feel involved with your game.
For this reason, it's always a good idea to test your stories and
your ideas with your test players.
You don't need to wait until you have a working game prototype.
You can invite testers at any point to see your ideas and to try out your story.
The earlier you can involve your players in your story planning, the better.
It will give you a game where your story feels more integrated with your game.

It's very helpful to start with your story as early as you can.
Also, sometimes a clever player might have a really interesting or
unique approach to your adventure.
You'll never know unless you try.

The purpose of playtesting is to...
  * find out how a player might interact with challenges in your game.
  * learn how to entice your player towards your chosen storyline.
  * see what parts of your game are most interesting to your players.

## Explaining an imagining

There's a lot of objects in games.
Bricks, robot fists, books, planets, magic hats.
And there are a lot of ways to represent these objects.
What we should keep in mind is that the way we represent the objects
in our game has a big effect on how our audience will interact with them.
It really changes the interaction if we have
a power-up that looks like a generic pellet or a kitten or a sandwich.
The audience has a different reaction to all three.
Using specific imagery has some big advantages.
It can give your world a rich and detailed look.
It can also help communicate to your player,
telling them how to interact with these objects.


So why isn't all imagery specific?
Why do we still see generic-looking pellets and
boring-looking objects in video games?
Well, sometimes the designer doesn't have time to add detail to everything.
They might choose to only give details to the most important pieces of their game.
Because their game has too many objects to give each one a unique and
interesting design.
Another reason could be that the design of a game could become cluttered if
every single object had a detailed and unique design.
Some objects need to be simple in order to push the player's attention
towards more important things.
Balancing simple and complicated things is an important part of game design and
the use of contrast is one of the most powerful tools you have to work with.
A third powerful reason that you may want to keep a design simple is that you
are using more than just imagery when you're describing your world
to the player.

The story can tell the audience how to interact with the object.
  * A mysterious pellet inside the informant's bag
  * An object that sings a little song when the player approaches?
  * What if the object moves in an interesting and unique way, hopping around like a rabbit?
  * What if the player can fly whenever they hold the object?
We have a lot of ways to communicate to our audience.
And it's important that we are aware of all the tools we have
when we're describing our world and telling our stories.

When a player encounters an object, we can tell them about it through:
 * imagery like showing it as a pellet, a kitten, a sandwich, or literally anything else.
 * We can use story, like finding an object in that informant's bag.
 * We can use sound, it can play a little song.
 * We can use behavior, it can be moving a certain way.
 * we can use interaction, the object might have an effect on the player and
the other objects that are in the world.

Now that's a lot of decision making and you probably won't be
going through that process for every single object in your game.
But it's something that you probably want to keep in mind for
the more important objects and environments.
The objects in your world help to tell a story to your players.
Each decision you make can have a big effect on how your
player interacts with the game.
So ask yourself, how do I want my player to feel?
And then try to find the method that helps to find those feelings inside
your audience.
