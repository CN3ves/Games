# Week 1: The Simplest Games
This week we start at the beginning: what are the principles of very simple games, like Hangman and tic-tac-toe? How do these games work? Why do people play them? What are the elements that define games and the gaming experience? And finally, what do games have in common with each other, and what sets them apart? In addition to covering the basics and ground rules for this course, we'll conclude this week with a very simple, low-tech assignment: create a game on a single sheet of paper.

## Introduction
In this course, we'll be talking about the structures and mechanics behind your favorite games.
 * What makes them work?
 * What makes them fun?
 * How they can tell stories?
 * How they can be improved?
 
We're gonna be focusing on the creative decisions a game
designer makes while they're making a game:
  * Who is your hero? 
  * What's their quest?
  * What challenges will they meet along the way?

These are the questions, which, when answered creatively.
Can make your game fun and allow you to connect with your players.

This course is the first in a four course series about video games that we're making
here at CalArts. We'll be focusing on the elements of game design in this course.
In others, we'll be learning about world design, character design and
storytelling. The goal of all four classes is to help you make a game design document, 
a text that you can use to describe your game to yourself and the world.

Each week's core lesson will introduce a key concept in game design, through examples and explanation. At the end of the week, you'll put that knowledge to work by making a game on paper that utilizes these key concepts. You'll be providing peer reviews of your classmates' games, learning and being inspired by a diverse range of ideas and solutions in their projects.

The idea behind this course is the things that make a game fun are the core ideas and creative decisions made early in development.

## Elements of Gaming

Keeping things simple is very important.
The simplicity of a game helps us pick it apart and
talk about how it works.
it has many of the things we'll find in a good video game.

**Goal**: It's pretty easy to figure out
the object of this game without reading the instructions.
It also has a few different goals to keep things interesting.
I can try something more difficult.
This is something you'll see in many popular games.
There's increasing levels of difficulty.
Part of this game's design is to add difficulty to our goal.
All games do this.
In fact, the main purpose of most game design, is to take our goal,
let's say finding a doorway, and design it to be difficult to reach, maybe
by hiding that doorway at the far end of a monster infested maze, under water and 
make it magically invisible.

**Chance and Skill**:
Two elements that affect a game's difficulty are chance and skill.
You may have heard of games of chance, and games of skill.
Game of chance would be something like roulette or the lottery.
In these games, victory is random.
Playing the lottery every single day,
doesn't make you better at playing the lottery.
Practice doesn't help your odds.
A game of skill would be something like chess or checkers.
There are no dice rolls or anything that adds randomness to the game.
Victory is based on the choices made by the players.
And the players' skill has a lot to do with their chance of winning.
Playing chess every day, would help improve a player's skills.
It would help their odds of winning the game.
As I practice, I can get better at the game.
Maybe try out different techniques and approaches.

You'll see a mix of chance and skill in a lot of games.
For instance, most card games create chance by shuffling the deck each time.
But they require skill in the way a player chooses to play their cards.
In a game like Tetris,
you have some chance as the computer chooses all the falling pieces.
But fitting the pieces together requires skill and forces a player to think and
to practice.
Introducing change to a game of skill adds variation and keeps the game interesting.

## The Game Design Document

A game design document it's a document that a game designer puts together as they're creating a game.
The format of the game design document varies depending on who puts it together,
or what type of game they're designing, or who the designer is working with.
There are a few things that show up in most game design documents.
  * Description of the game  
  * Description of the game play involved
  * Description of the game's goals, puzzles and characters
  * Illustrations, maps and story lines.

Some of the document might include technical writing about different
programming techniques involved with the game's production.

Basically, the game design document is a book that clarifies how the game works.
The game design document is an important tool, because in a modern game company
there may be hundreds of people all working on the same game.
A game design document helps keep everyone on the same page.
It's something that anyone can refer to if they have questions about the game.
It's also frequently updated and revised during production,
since the game might have small or large changes over the course of writing,
programming, play testing and any other step of the process.
As a lone game designer, a game design document is also very important.
It's a place where someone can gather their ideas.
In the early stages, it can almost be a scrapbook of
thoughts as a designer figures out what their game is all about.
Even though they might not have to communicate with a big company,
a game design document can help the lone game designer communicate with themselves.
It can remind them of their initial concepts and
it can keep them on a steady path.
There's a lot that can go into a game design document, and
there's a lot of variety between game design documents for different games.
In this course, we'll be working on skills that will help us make our game design
documents richer, more creative, and more fun.

Why is a game design document useful to a game designer?
  * It helps them describe their game to themselves.
  * It gives them a document that can be shared with all their collaborators.
  * It allows a game designer to put all their thoughts and ideas about their game in one place.
  
## Feedback

Feedback very important as it's the method we have for
evaluating and learning with each other.
With that information, I can try to change it so that itâ€™s more interesting.
We'd spoken earlier about goals in gaming, so maybe I can change my game so
that it starts with an explorer landing in a strange forest,
and at the end, there's a lost cave filled with treasure.
That would be a more interesting goal.
We also talked about chance and skill in gaming, and
how some difficulty can make a game more interesting.
Well, I could add some change with a roll of dice.
Instead of my player moving just one space every turn, they could roll a die and
move between one and six spaces each turn.
If I wanted to add some skill, I could change that path of my game into a maze.
There, I think my game's looking more interesting.

When reviewing a project, here's some steps you can follow.
 * Examine the project, think about it and try to figure out how you feel about it
 * Try to figure out why you feel that way, then share your thoughts and your reasoning.


## Making a Simple Game and Brainstorming

One of the hardest parts of starting to make a game is getting started in
the first place.
I find that students and designers can waste a lot of time trying to think of
a perfect idea that they can use for the basis of their project.
So, first off, there are no perfect ideas.

Even though thet are not perfect ideas, they can are interesting ideas.
An interesting idea is a great place to start.
It can start your curiosity, and
it can inspire questions that your game can help answer.
After you decide on an idea,
there's usually something that happens shortly afterwards.
Your idea starts to look like a bad idea.
You'll find problems with it, and maybe you'll start to think it's a silly idea.
This is a totally normal part of the process.
Digging into a project starts to expose the problems with that idea, but
every idea has problems and finding creative solutions to these problems
is the way game designer really get to define their projects.

So, how do you come up with an idea in the first place?
 * Relax. It's hard to think creatively when you're stressed out.
 * Try brainstorming some lists. You can try to brainstorm some lists of possible characters, or titles, or inspiring words, or professions, anything you think will help get your brain going. It's important that any list you make be as long as possible. You'll want to give yourself plenty of options. I find that the second half of my lists, after I've relaxed and gotten a bit silly, usually are better than the first half when I'm still worried about making a good idea.
 * Try a theme. For instance, I find that some students find it easier if I give them a general theme to start with. Something vague but clear enough that it still narrows down the choices a little bit. For instance, you could make your game about travel or your first day at a new job or a ghost story.
We could seek some outside inspiration. Maybe we could find some books or art or movies that can get us some ideas that are new to us, rather than things that we're familiar with.
