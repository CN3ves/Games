# Week 4: The Friend and the Enemy
What purpose does an enemy serve in a game? What effect does a second player have on two-player games? Can a game work without an adversary or a final goal? We'll address all of those questions in this last week of the class, and work towards finalizing your board game project with characters. 

## Introduction to Characters

For this week, which is the last one for this introductory class, we'll be talking
about characters and multiplayer elements that can be added to our games.
The different ways they're used and the ways that we can use them to make
your game a more fun experience for your players.
Bringing in extra characters for your player to interact with, whether they be
real-life friends in a multiplayer game, or computer operated characters can
bring personalities, surprise, and unpredictability to your game.

## Characters in Gaming

There are two kinds of characters in a video game, a PC and an NPC.
  * PC stands for player character, and they're characters in the game that are controlled by real humans. Multiplayer games can have more than one PC, but the general rule is that any character is a PC if a real human gets to control their actions.
  *  NPC stands for non-player character,band it refers to any character controlled by the computer.

How can you get personality into your NPC's?
It may seem impossible at first,
to trick a player into believing that your NPC is a real thinking character,
but people are always projecting personalities onto inanimate objects.
Let's take a simple example that could work in your game project.
  * If your game was a car game,your player was moving along a path and
they were rolling standard dice to see how many space they could move.
The dice would give them a number between one and six, so
on average they would be moving about three and a half spaces.
You could make an NPC opponent that would compete with your player. 
  *If this NPC moves three spaces every turn, this NPC would normally lose.
  * If the NPC moved four spaces every turn, they would win on average, but these races would normally be pretty close.
  * Now, what would happen if we made an NPC that could move only one or two spaces every turn?
  They'd be slow, and they'd usually lose. They now have a quality that's outside the norm, they're especially slow. The player might start projecting some personality onto this NPC, seeing them as a sad, unlucky loser or a  slow poke.
  * What if we had a NPC that moved five or six spaces every turn? They'd almost always win and the player would almost certainly develop some strong feelings towards this NPC, seeing them as a difficult adversary or a villain or a super fast driver.
By changing just one number, we can take two identical NPC's and
change them into two characters that the player will see as having different
personalities, a slowpoke and a super faster racer.

All along we've been stressing simplicity in our game making.
We're keeping our rules minimal and
we're letting the players imagination create the story.
Imagine the way your game would be seen as different if the imagery representing your
NPC's were designed in different ways.
  * If we took the NPC racer that moves only one or two spaces each turn and designed them to look like a fancy race car driver with an expensive race car, the player might see them as an over funded but incompetent driver who is all show and no go.
  * If we took the NPC that moves five or six spaces each turn and designed them to look like a rough and tumble racer with a beat up old car,the player might see them as a lucky old timer.

All these personalities and emotions are created by adjusting one number and
a bit of imagery.

These small changes can be quite powerful in shaping the experience of your player,
and these NPC's are essentially just running a script.
They aren't reacting at all to what's happening during the game play.
So what if they did?
  * What if we created an NPC that always moved one or two spaces
until they were losing, and then they'd always move five or six spaces each turn?
We'd have a character that might seem kind of clueless at first, and
then fiercely competitive.
  * What if we had an NPC character that did the opposite? They could start out moving five or six spaces per turn until they were ahead and then only move one or two spaces per turn when they were in the lead.
This would make a character that might seem like a show-off.

The previous example created some extra personality for our NPC characters,
by giving them a condition whether or not they were winning.
NPC's can react to all sorts of things.
  * Maybe a NPC might only start to move when the player gets too close.
  * Maybe they might only appear after a player reaches a certain number of points or chooses a certain path.

All these conditional behaviors can be use to make your NPC's feels
like they are thinking, and that makes them more believable to your players.
Remember, you don't need to make NPC's that actually think, you just
need to make NPC characters who appear to be thinking.

## Types of Characters

So what types of characters does your game need?
Well, let's talk about some of the types of non-player
characters you might include in your game, and the purposes they might serve.
  * Villains: Villains are great. They mess up stuff, so your hero will need to fix it.
They give personality to the problems your player needs to solve.
A good villain can make a series of problems feel like a specific adventure.
If your villain is doing their job, they'll create some strong adversarial
feelings with your player, and make the victory all the sweeter.
However, keep in mind that sometimes villians can make our planning too easy.
They can end up behind every single problem, and that might get repetitive or
even nonsensical.
Don't forget that there is all sorts of reasons your player could find challenges
that could be outside a villians power, like mistakes, or natural disasters, or
a betrayal.
  * Townspeople: Adding some towns people can help make your world feel like a real
place with real consequences. If everyone is a hero or a monster, your game can feel unreal or cartoonish, which isn't always a bad thing. But a towns person can tell your player what their world is like, they can tell stories, give tips, or fill in details from your game that your
player wasn't around to experience otherwise.
  * Adventurers: Your player might run into fellow adventurers, they could be good, or not so
nice, they could help your players, or they could be competing with your player towards the same goal.
The nice thing about adventurers, is sometimes, they've already tried the things your player is about to attempt. And they can have unique perspectives and secrets that they might share for a price.
  * Friends: Running in to old friends is a good way of adding back story to your game.
A character's friends can tell you a lot about that character. If all their friends are woodland animals or spiders or nerds or jocks or imaginary, it's going to say something about that character.
  * Monsters: Classic monsters. Monsters in every shape and size, from the microscopic to the planet-sized, they're the most widely used NPCs in all of video games. Monsters aren't only there to challenge your character, they can also help your player learn something about their world, or even change the course of your adventure. For instance, your player might encounter a bear, and when your player is bitten, they might suddenly have a strong taste for honey. And they become a ware-bear! That could really change the course of your game.

  * Turn coats and traders: Speaking of wear bears, any of these characters can change into any other character. A friend might become a monster, a monster might become a friend, who knows? When you feel like you need to add a new character to your project, take a moment to ask yourself if the point you are trying to achieve can be met by revisiting a previous character and learning something new about them. That way, you'll end up with a character that has more depth rather than two characters that you've only partially developed.

 This is by no means a complete list of character types. I didn't even get into hermits, or ghosts, or astronauts. The list goes on. The point is, there's a lot a new character can add to your story, and there's a lot an old character can add to your story if something new is revealed in them

If you want to make a character more interesting, you could...
  * reveal something new about the character.
  * change the character into a different type of character.
  * use the character to reveal something about your game's setting.

## Multiplayer rules and balance

Whatever you do with the rules, it's important that they have balance.
How do you make a multi-player game that has balance?
The easiest way is to have both characters start with identical abilities.

What happens though when you want a game where both players need to have
different abilities?
That's where we need to think about balance in our rules.
Now most of you have seen this before.
There is usually a choice between characters with different advantages and
disadvantages.
A character might be powerful but slow.
Another might be weaker but fast.
Ideally, none of the character choices should be a guarantee of
victory or defeat.
If that were the case, why play the game?

Try out your character balances with play testers and
if they can't all agree which character is the best choice, it's a good sign.

People might want to try both characters instead of feeling like they're stuck with the bad character.
Of course, this would need some play testing to make sure things are balanced.
And numbers would need to be tweaked.

Another type of balance we need to talk about in multiplayer games,
is a balance between winners and losers.
Have you ever played a game where at some point it felt like you were starting to
lose and after that, it felt impossible to come back from behind and win?
This can be disheartening to a player.
It can make them stop trying, and
can leave them feeling disconnected from your game.
Hopefully a player will always feel like they are capable of winning,
until the moment they lose.

Close games are fun to be a part of, and they're interesting until the end.
What are some methods to balance winners and losers in a multiplayer game?
  * Give the re-spawning loser time to gather their senses and try again.
  * Make it easier fot the losing characters to target teh winning character 
  * Gives the winners a slight disadvantage
  
Balance is very important in multiplayer games.
It's important to give the players an equal chance of winning the game.
And it's also important to make sure that the game is designed to be a close game
in order to keep it interesting all the way through for both players.
And not just the winner.
