## Assignment 

In this assignment you are asked to try reimagining The Shooter differently than how I’ve presented it in this class. 

If you didn’t already try it, use the Idea Sheets method to pull together some rough ideas for the quest, protagonist goals, antagonist goals and settings stemming from this undeveloped spine:

The Shooter is about a man who is out to show everyone that he’s the best shot in the world.

Next, assemble some of your best ideas to write:

 * OPTIONAL: the Spine (logline) of your version of The Shooter.
 * The Story Synopsis of your version of The Shooter (200-400 words). Try to hit all 8 points of a good synopsis.
 * A Character Brief for the protagonist AND the antagonist (100-300 words each). Try to hit all 6 points of what makes a good character description in each brief.
 * Setting Descriptions (100-300 words) that outlines the major locations/levels (2-3 maximum) and how a character would travel from place to place. 

Finally, to give your peers some context, include a short statement about your approach to The Shooter. How is it different, and why?

Write all five components (Synopsis, two Character Briefs, Setting Descriptions, and statement) directly in each submission window. The spine is optional in this assignment.

Give your project a title (a new game title, if you wish), and submit!

## Submission
 1. OPTIONAL: Write the Spine (logline) of your version of The Shooter here.

"The Shooter" is about Jake, an ex-security sharpshooter whose past failure led to the demise of his companions. Having barely survived, Jake blames himself for that fateful mistake and he is slowly consumed by the guilt leading him into a long depression and alcohol abuse. Jake has isolated himself, still living in the past with a deep nostalgia for what he used to be. However, he is dragged back to reality by rapidly evolving events. Given the opportunity to find his old self, Jake joins the fight against a dangerous criminal group and the ghosts from his past.

 2. Write the Synopsis of your version of The Shooter here (200-400 words). Try to hit all 8 points of a good synopsis.

Jake, a disgraced ex-security agent, haunted by his past failure, longs for the person he once was. One day, as he walks the City gardens, he witnesses an explosion and the resulting shootout between security forces and  criminals. This inciting incident initiates the first level: Jake is forced into action, navigating the gardens to find and protect the civilians.

Jake recognizes Rudy, once his student and now a security agent, who stands with Emily after she was shot by Dead Eye J., a dangerous sharpshooter, rumored to be the best of the best. Emily needs assistance and Rudy cannot continue the chase, setting the initial tension: Jake has to help fighting the criminals but Jake  has to prove that he is still the best shot by challenging Dead Eye J.

Jake opens a (futuristic) connection with Rudy and catches up with the criminals, starting the second level: Jake fights the criminals in an industrial site filled with automatons, which complicate the fight. The tension rises as Jake realizes that he lost the criminals’ trail, remembering his past failure and starting to doubt himself.

Rudy contacts Jake, telling him that Phil, a mutual friend, needs back-up immediately, initiating the third level: Jake helps Phil take down the criminals in a warehouse. As the fight progresses, Patrick, a well-known anti-technology criminal, takes down Phil’s forces one by one, but remains hidden. Patrick constantly taunts Jake with his echoing voice, ending up revealing that Jake failure resulted from someone tempering with his pistol. Jake finds Patrick and a boss fight occurs.

Phil suspects that there was a traitor in Jake’s unit, responsible for setting him up to fail that fateful shot. With his past catching up, Jake has to find out more and continues through to the final stage. He recognizes Dead Eye J. as his presumably dead lover, starting the conflict of Jake with his past. She is surprised, yet happy, to see him, admitting to being spy and regretting for all the pain she caused him. Still having feelings for him, she asks him to join her, so they can be together again. Jake refuses and the final conflict starts. Defeated, Jane reiterates her feelings and her conviction that society must free itself from the shackles of technology to survive.

At the height of tension, the player is given a choice: kill her for revenge, arrest her for justice, or free her for love. The resolution depends on this choice. Jake proved that he is the best shot, regaining his confidence and  and finally letting the past behind him. Jane’s death triggers a strong retaliation by the rebels and the final image is that of a shootout in a ruined neighborhood. Jane’s arrest results in her trial and conviction and the final image is Jane escaping prison looking for revenge. Jane’s freedom will result in her laying low and the last image will be of her visiting Jake at his home.

 3. Write a Character Brief for the protagonist of The Shooter (150-300 words). Try to hit all 6 points of what makes a good character description.

Jake was born and raised in the City, joining the security forces in hopes of contributing to a safer society. He was the best shot of the security forces but when it mattered, when he had but one shot, he failed, condemning his tactical unit. Barely surviving, his confidence was shattered and he was dragged into a deep depression by his guilt. Jake looks older than his age, with white hair and unkempt beard. He maintains his strength and flexibility from the continuous training, a part of his former self he kept during his darkest times. He wears worn out shirt and his old security trousers. His pistol, a trophy from his past glories, is supported on a holster tied to his right leg.

Jake has a deeply negative view of his own worth. He is oppressed by a constant feeling of guilt for the lives of his friends, his lover Jane, and for his failure to prevent the rebellion. He tries to hide his doubts as much as possible, but he is haunted by his past, a feeling which resurfaces from time to time. However, his motivation and will to restore his former self, rekindled by his chance meeting with Rudy, will push him to his limits and drive him into confrontation with a criminal group that is trying to escape. He now returns to find the truth and find redemption for his past mistake. He must show to himself that he is the best shot in the world or ultimately be consumed by his guilt. He is rusty from his dark days, but he still has an unmatched agility and precision. He can keep calm under great pressure and patiently wait for the right time for the best shot. However, his lack of confidence and his fear that another failure may cost more lives keeps him unfocused and hesitant.

 4. Write a Character Brief for the antagonist of The Shooter (150-300 words). Try to hit all 6 points of what makes a good character description.
Dead Eye Jane is the main antagonist. Jane came from a small farming village, where technology abruptly pushed people out of their jobs. The pressure of rising unemployment, crashed the local economy and Jane was forced to move elsewhere looking for a better live. As an ambitious but naive young woman in the City she wanted to profit as much as she could from her access to technology, taking too many risks. When this when wrong, she started to believe that technology as the catalyst of social disruption and joined with anti-technology activists.

A middle-aged woman with a hard and serious expression. Her black hair contrasts with her piercing cold blue eye. She wears her old tactical combat suit and carries an automatic rifle around her shoulder with a number of devices tied to her belt. Jane’s nickname refers to an experimental implant, the "dead-eye", that increases her shooting abilities. However, something went wrong and this device changed her. Jane is a bitter, vengeful member of a rebellious group who aims at putting an end to all bionic improvements and artificial forms of intelligence. She was the one who manipulated and sabotaged Jake’s operation and contributing to his failure, allowing the rise of the rebellion. She is now responsible of the explosion at the University Research Facilities and is trying to escape the security forces, knowing very well that she will not be given a second change if caught.

She regrets the pain she caused Jake, and still harbors feelings for him, but in her eyes, her actions are fully justified as they will prevent mankind from destroying itself. Her unique and undivided focus on revenge is fundamental to archiving her goals, but it also isolates her and blinds her, sometimes putting herself in difficult situations. 

 5. Write a Setting Description (100-300 words) that outlines the major locations/levels (2-3 maximum) and how a character would travel from place to place. 

At some undefined point in the future, the invention of the “nodes” brought mankind into a new age of communication. These little devices are able to “read thoughts” and translate them into the cyberspace, facilitating communication between humans and with machines. Under a layer of secure identification and access protocols, this single invention brought great social improvement, leading to the creation of a technical utopia, the City, where technology permeates all part of society and the rise of bionic medicine and artificial intelligence is just a stone’s throw away. However, doubts have been cast on these transhumanising technologies after an unnamed event, becoming a divisive issue in society and the underlying conflict of the plot.

All the story occurs in the City, a huge, bright and wide space, where the greatest scientific minds are gathered at the University, a shining symbol of hope for humanity’s future for those who believe in transhumanism, but a brutal symbol of slavery for the human purists. The game progressively moves between two places that are the symmetric opposite of each other.

Level one starts close in the a paradisiac garden surrounding the University Research Center, a wide, bright and peaceful place with a lush mixture of colours, sounds and smells. Level two sees the tranquility of the gardens disrupted by for the bustling noise of automatons hurryingly working like clockwork in the still bright and clean industrial zone. The industrial zone is dotted with warehouses, where level three occurs, moving into a darker space, filled with all kings of stored goods and losing the previous feeling of openness. Level four occurs in a secret network of dark, humid and warm underground tunnels, Even though this level is again silent, it is in such a different setting that this silence becomes deafening and oppressing, a feeling reinforced by the narrow and poorly ventilated underground passages.

 6. Write a statement that describes your approach to The Shooter. What did you change, and why?

I found that the requirement (from the kernel) to “be the best shot” was a bit limiting and kept me going back to the idea of defining “best” through a competition. As such, the main change I did was deciding to move away from the concept of competition (sports) and explore settings with a more abstract definition of “best”, being more about self-worth and overcoming difficulties (through shooting) than literary being about getting the “gold medal”. My initial scribbles led me to a cyberpunk setting, but I decided to turn it around on itself. We have a conflict that arises from the threat of technology to society, but the setting is not a dystopia and the failure of technology is a predicted treat that has not materialized yet. This setting would allow me to make a shooting game with many different weapons concepts (the idea of the game) while focusing on an abstract iade of what is a of “best shot”.

I kept the four stages/level structure and the character of each level from the class’ game version. I maintained Jake’s tragic past and designed him around a disgraced character looking to prove himself as well. I also tied both Jake and Jane together by having Jane, once again, sabotaging Jake and being the primary culprit for his fall from grace. The rising action was also maintained by the interaction with the secondary characters, again having Patrick providing the critical revelation and rise the action to the final confrontation.

However with a different setting, I had to re-define what was the past accident for Jake (missing that one shot), what was the motivation for Jane (her past experiences with technology) and how these would tie with the setting. The story then grew around these fixed points. Finally, I moved the climax from the shootout with Jane to a player’s choice as I though it would bring an unexpected ending and engage the player further with the story.

### Comments
What is the strongest or most compelling thing about the student’s submission? Is there something they wrote that made you want to read more?
  1. There is so much details that makes the history really realistic! Good Job!
  2. Amazing story! I like the idea in your story exploration where both the protagonist and antagonist are right from their own perspectives and the player has to make a choice in the end. 
The player is consistently at a state of conflict in your story.

   1. It is really good sorry I don't know what to say ahah
