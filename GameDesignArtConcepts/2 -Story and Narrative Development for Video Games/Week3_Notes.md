# Week 3 Story Workshop

This week, we explore ideation techniques and learn how to consolidate our ideas into more formalized stories specifically for pushing them towards a game design. We will take a look at the importance of, and ways to refine, characters and settings as we develop an initial concept in story form first, and then next week, into a game.


## Story Ideation Techniques

You really have to find yourself at a certain point, where you've already
made some decisions that are important about the game you wanna make,
before you start fitting a story to it: 
  * Settling on the type, or genre of game, it's gonna help dictate what, and how your story's gonna fit.
  *  Do you know where and when your games gonna be set?

Get to know these little things, and when you have a pretty good idea of the type
and setting of your game, when you've got this kernel of a game, as I like
to call it, the work on hammering out your story behind that game can start.


So, for me, storylines stem from characters, and the situations you put them in.

1. Quest ideas

 * Start with a goal for the hero of your game, and write it down at the top of a piece of paper.
*The warrior princes must find a magic scepter.*
 * Then, begin by defining a number of answers to why this goal has to be achieved.
*The scepter was her father's, and without it, the king will lose his power.*
 * Push that definition further by asking what else is gonna happen? What else and why?
*The power of the king comes from the scepter, and the person who holds it rules the land.*

Now, and this is really important, don't edit anything.
Don't erase anything.
Don't delete.
Just let your mind wander around that question of,
why is this goal so important?
Now I guarantee, from that list of answers,
I'm sure you're gonna hit some real gems that are gonna be useful for your story.

2. Now, start with another sheet of paper: Protagonist ideas.
 * Write down in one sentence how the hero of the story
feels about the quest, and why they're the one for that mission.
*The warrior princess, she feels honor bound to save her kingdom.*
 * Again, ask why, and move down that list.
*She craves her father's love and respect.*
*She wants to exact revenge on the magician who stole the scepter.*
I guarantee, again, every now and then you're gonna hit on some of these
answers that are gonna resonate with you, when it's time to review that sheet.
For example, for this made up warrior princess game we've been talking about,
as I was scribbling out these ideas and prepping for this course, a line I
scribbled read, *she feels guilty that she let the scepter fall into the wrong hands*.
When I reviewed that sheet, it struck me pretty hard, and I let my brain really
start molding who the princess was, around that idea, and what made her tick.
It showed me that she has weaknesses that we can use in the process of the story.
The more of these scribbles that you allow yourself to put out,
the more fuel you're gonna have to flesh out your story.
Just promise yourself don't
go back to reread your sheets until your done with this part of the process.


3. Let's a start a third sheet: Antagonist ideas

* Write down the goal of the antagonist.
* What makes him or her stand in the way of the hero?
* And fill that sheet with answers to why they oppose the hero.

Some of these,
they're gonna give you great ideas to flesh out the villain of your game.

4. We're gonna go with a fourth sheet of paper: Setting ideas

* Write down a single line describing
different aspects of where the game takes place, and work your way down the sheet.
Now you already have an idea of where and when your game takes place,
from that little kernel that we came up with, at the start of this process.
It's time to flush that kernel out a little bit more, and scribble
out thoughts that will, eventually, will become descriptors for your locations.
We came up with stuff like, *the princess's kingdom, it's lush and
green and beautiful*.
*The scepter's power helps keep the land fresh, and in beautiful weather, and
the rivers flowing*.
*Neighboring lands around our kingdom are arid, stark, and dry*.

Get that page going.
Don't judge what you're writing.
When you start liking some of these scribbles,
when you do review, they're gonna help you design your world.

5. Flesh out the spine

Now, we're gonna move on to taking these lines, and
weave them together into a tapestry, that's gonna become your backdrop.

Now, starting with that first sheet, the goals ideas sheet,
pick about six to ten of these lines, about why the hero's goal is so important.
And start finding ways to write out paragraphs that connect
those lines together.
That way you expand the goals sheet into a new piece of paper,
in paragraph form, that interconnect those scribbles.
That's gonna flush out your storyline's goal, and
make it a much richer story for your game.
Once you're done with that, you're gonna do the same with the other idea sheets.
For the protagonist, the antagonist, and the setting of your game.

This is the perfect time to develop that emotional relationship between
the hero and the villain, and why there's that conflict between them.
You should have about four sheets of paper,
at this point, that are about half a page or more each,
that begin to tell a storyline based on that kernel that we started out with.
Not all of this history that you've written out
needs to be exposed in the game.
But all of this information is gonna help build strong descriptions for
you for everything in your game, just like we talked about in the previous suites.
Take all of that together, and figure out, what's the story's developed spine?

Our original spine, *the warrior princess must find the magic scepter*,
that doesn't hold up now, does it?

If you haven't found a new developed spine,
with all that work that you're doing, then there's just something missing, and
you should really start again and do new sheets.
Most likely,
though, you'll probably be saying your spine is much more developed now.
*Betrayed and alone,
a warrior princess must redeem herself, and prove herself worthy of her father,
the King by returning a magic scepter to her kingdom, and vanquishing
the evil magic from the barren lands that surround and threaten her world*.
Now that sounds like a more solid story spine to me.

## Personal Writing Advice

For me writing is one of the most enjoyable, but frustrating and
anxiety causing things in my life.
But when I set out to write for somebody else, whether it's a creative project or
not, I have to find that special place in my mind
where I allow myself to move on and actually be productive.
Maybe some of you will resonate along with this feeling, but I really am,
my own worst enemy, and I put myself through a neurotic hell,
before even the first words hit my keyboard.


You have to find your comfort zone, and you have to allow yourself the room to be
creative, and think beyond the simple mechanics of your game, and
get into the creative guts of why these things happen the way they do.
Explore the emotions of the game and,
in doing so, you're going to bring a lot of yourself into it.
To do that,
I want to tell you about the single best advice I've gotten from a writing teacher Michael McCarthy.
  1. dedicate a routine for yourself: Set aside a number of minutes per day, where you do nothing but prepare and write. When you're on a project like a game you wanna create, take a week and everyday of that week, set aside 60 minutes. Find a place where it's quiet and no one is gonna bother you.And your not gonna distract yourself with emails or calls or games or anything.That sixty minutes and in that place your spending your time purely on your story.
  2. Set a timer, and spend the first 15 minutes reading. Read anything.
  Just don't read what you've written before. It gets you all judgey about your own stuff, and
definitely do not get on the internet. The Internet's a black-hole of time.
  3. The next 15 minutes, spend writing out those single line ideas. Pepper that sheet of paper with scribbles and thoughts about that single subject. Like the sheet of ideas on why the heroes goal in your game is so important. If you get to the end of that sheet and you still have some of that 15 minutesleft, start a new sheet, but stay on that same idea.
  4. Then take a one or two minute break and don't do anything. Sit there and just stare at something.  
  5. There's just under 30 minutes left of your hour, and in that time, take a look and
review the idea sheet you just wrote. And start making the connections that we talked about in the last lecture. Write that out in a paragraph form on a new sheet of paper,
on those six to ten ideas and how they correlate to each other, and how they
build on top of each other to craft a richer description of your starting idea.
  6. When 60 minutes is up, stop and walk away, and get on with the rest of your day. Now it's okay to maybe go a minute over here or there, but don't run wild at this point. 
  But the deal is, commit to that hour fully, every single day for that week.

By the end of that week you should have some pretty good, fleshed-out ideas for
your goals and your settings and your characters.
You can easily build on this every week.
Slowly increase this sacred time you spend writing on your game.

But you have to stay consistent with it.
This is key.
Don't let anything pull you away before that time is up.
And don't let it keep you there longer than that time.
That discipline, when I use it, really helps me get over my own fears,
and regiments me into writing so many things that I've been most proud of.


### About Idea Sheets

In the previous lectures, we discussed creating Idea Sheets to generate ideas and thoughts on various aspects of your game story. These lists are for you to freestyle brainstorm thoughts onto paper to commit them to words, without judgement or hesitation. The concept is to allow yourself free-form creativity and just throw these ideas, however useful they may end up being, down on paper. As you may recall, the Idea Sheets I recommend are for the following:

1. Game Goals Idea Sheet - The hero’s quest in the game

2. Protagonist Idea Sheet - How the hero feels about his goals, developing wider character goals

3. Antagonist Idea Sheet - Goals and motivations for the antagonist

4. Settings and Levels Idea Sheet - Settings and environments where the story takes place.

Once you have these ideas scribbled out, you can begin to formulate connections between them and sculpt them into clearer descriptions and cohesive designs.

In the following examples, I've presented two of the Idea Sheets I generated by hand while I was thinking The Shooter. The first is for the antagonist, Dead-Eye Jane. The second is for the locations and settings of the game and how they could be game levels. I have typed them up without editing them for legibility, but I do suggest that you write them out by hand when creating them.

As you read these, keep in mind only a handful of these ideas end up being used in the game and character descriptions. And that is what this is all about! Most of them are thrown away in the end, but the ones that stick can be essential to the characters and the world of the game. I have highlighted the ideas on these sheets that I want to use moving forward in the game creation.

## Refining the Spine

We talked about creating four sheets of single sentence ideas called
idea sheets to scribble out ideas for 
  1. the hero's quest in the game.
  2. how the hero feels about the goals, which develops the character with wider character goals.
  3. goals and motivations for the antagonist.
  4. settings and environments where the story takes place.

So now let’s try workshopping, making a whole new game using these
techniques to find its story to put all this stuff into practice.
I wanna make a shooting game where the game play is first person and
the player has to target shoot their way to the top of the pack through all these
crazy levels and all these cool guns and ammo and be the best shooter in the world.
Let's call it The Shooter.
Clever, isn't it?

So that's the kernel of my game idea.
Let's say, just for now that the spine is *the shooter is about
a man who's out to show everyone that he's the best shot in the world* and
we can kind of build off of that.
So, I started by creating the first two idea sheets.
One for the quest and one for the hero's goal for the story.
From those, I picked a few I really liked and
I connected them together to get to this point.
It's important to the hero, Jake to win the competition, because he has
already been written off by the league of shooters as being too old and too rusty.
He's been out of the circuit too long and no one,
absolutely no one thinks twice about him anymore.
So now I have to ask myself, why?
Why has this guy been out of the league for so long?
Why is he being written off as too old and rusty?

And I came up with the idea, because his wife and
daughter were killed in a car accident that only he walked away from.
But now after years of physical therapy and guilt and training,
he dare show his face again in the league of shooters.
But now, he's got a personal mission to prove that he's still got it to
finally put the past behind him and rebuild his new life to honor his family.
Again, I ask myself, why has he gotta prove himself?
Why can't he just retire from shooting and just go read a book somewhere?
What worked for me was coming to the idea right before the accident,
he was almost the top shooter in the league.
He only had to defeat one other shooter Dead-Eye Jane, the deadliest shot in
the league and now it's president and then boom, this accident happens.
So now with that why answered, I know that Jake absolutely has to win,
there is really no going back for him.
This is his true quest and that's the main push of the game.
So, our spine is now developing and we have fleshed out goals for
the player in the game that ties them in on an emotional level with the audience.
As I wrote out these idea sheets,
it became pretty apparent to me who Jake was becoming.
And that his opposing force, the antagonist, it wasn't the competition.
It wasn't how difficult these targets were gonna be to shoot,
but it was actually this new character; Dead-Eye Jane.
And from that, I've got topics to start off the third sheet that I need,
the antagonists idea sheet that develop Dead-Eye Jane as a character.
Now lastly, for my fourth idea sheet,
I would move on to ideas for where all this takes place.
Scribbling out ideas for the League of Shooters, the competition, how it's
set up and some of the arenas that Jake has to go through to win the game.
Once I finish those two idea issues, the last two of the four,
I make connections between some of those ideas, to make a more developed
character for Dead-Eye Jane and more developed settings for the game.
Then I would write the shooter's story synopsis based around all of this fleshed
out information and this newly developed spine and get the synopsis going.
From this, I can say confidently that our spine now reads, *Jake,
a forgotten and broken man is back in the toughest competitive shooting
circuit to reclaim his name at the top of the ferocious League of Shooters and
to make sense of the tragedy that claimed his family's life*.
Now that sounds a lot better than hey, I wanna make a game about shooting,
a bunchConnecting Ideas and Characters of targets.

## Connecting Ideas and Characters

Now let's start workshopping the story synopsis for the shooter.
We already have developed ideas for the hero, and the villain, and
the settings from the idea sheets.
We need to make sure that we hit the eight important points from last week for
a good synopsis that describes our game.
the synopsis for the shooter doesn't need to exactly be written point by point
through all eight questions in order.
You just have to make sure somewhere in your texts that you answer all
eight of those questions in an easy to read way as possible.

With that in mind, let's flesh out a few points to consider,
so that you can take over, and write your own full synopsis for
the shooter, complete with your own ideas and details.
Jake has a lot to prove to the league of shooters.
He has to start fresh at the bottom of the pile,
and work his way back up to where he once was, before the accident.
He starts the story by entering into the first level of competition.
Now how do we establish this backstory in the game?
We can start with a cut scene animation, where he walks into
the office of the league of shooters to sign up for the competition.
We see through dialogue, that he has been gone a long time,
that he's ready to move on from what's happened to him in the past.
All of this can be exposed through dialogue between him and
a secondary character that we'll call Rudy at the sign up.
And with Jinx saying, well, I'm back, Rudy,
and this time I'm here to take it all, we're off and running.
And he's in the first round of the shooting competition,
which he very easily wins, moving on to the next round.
Keeping in mind that we need to keep the action and attentions rising,
we need to move Jake into a tougher round of competition,
with tougher shooters competing against him.
This can introduce new secondary characters that
expose more of the story in the game.
During this round, perhaps in conversation with another contestant,
let's call her Emily.
We can learn that Jake feels guilty about his family's death.
That he's the only survivor of the crash.
We start seeing more of his wider character goals.
From Emily, Jake can learn a few things about Dead Eye Jane.
How she took over the league of shooters after his accident, and
has been consolidating her power ever since Jake was no longer around.
This introduces her as a possible antagonist.
So, he beats the second round of competition with a little bit of trouble,
but with great shooting, moving him into the elite third round,
where he reunites with a former shooting buddy, Phil.
Phil lets Jake know that Dead Eye Jane has been a thorn in his own side,
and that he's been suspicious that Dead Eye Jane has been
actually rigging some of the competition arenas, to make sure that she and
her henchmen are the winners every year.
This begins to cement the idea of Jane as the antagonist,
and, possibly, a new set of immediate goals for Jake.
Just barely beating the third round of targets, Jake is now in the semifinals,
where he squares off with some of Dead Eye James's henchmen.
We can start exposing parts of the story that show Dead Eye James's dislike for
Jake, to further that protagonist, antagonist relationship.
During the confrontation in the game play, as Jake is shooting against
Dead Eye James's top lieutenant, Patrick, we see that Patrick is winning,
edging out Jake in points, making us feel as if Jake is gonna lose.
Then, during taunting, Patrick let's slip how Dead Eye
was somehow involved in the car accident that took Jake's family.
That she's been trying to sabotage Jake all those years ago, and
that it all worked to her benefit that Jake was a broken man, and
has nothing left, and Jane is taking all the power.
This of course, energizes Jake.
And he rallies himself to beat Patrick in the competition, by the skin of his teeth,
moving him onto the finals against Dead Eye Jane herself.
He has regained the admiration of some of his old comrades,
through his great shooting, and learns of how Dead Eye Jane is setting him up for
failure yet again, in the final round.
She has changed the rules to make the final round a death match.
Shooter versus shooter, as opposed to shooting targets.
So, we've gone through act one, and we're at the final crisis at the end of act two,
where the hero and the villain are in their ultimate battle.
We've been rising the action all along, and
exposing the story line through secondary characters.
