# Week 4 From Story to Game

For this last week of class, we will begin by seeing what a game design document is, and evaluate a few different templates you can use. Then, we will take the story we built in last week’s course, The Shooter, and define it as a playable game outlined in a game design document. 


## Introduction to a Game Design Document

A design document is a document that sets out the design of your game, and is really very handy
to use as pitch materials to pitch your fully fleshed out game idea.
There are several different ones out there and it's up to you to find one that works best for you.
However, it's important to see how the game story materials you've been creating
here can fit into any game design document template.
So let's get to know a general game design document.

#### Introduction
  1. Generally want to start off with an explanation of what your game is
as an intro. *What's your game story and why the reader of your design document should really care and like it*. This is the perfect place to **throw in the spine** that you developed
to hook your reader in and get them interested.This is why having a really snazzy and electric spine is so important.
  2. Then I suggest moving on to a very brief explanation of the objective of your game.
Perhaps in a short couple of paragraphs. What are you doing as the player to accomplish (the game goal) whatever you just set out in your spine? Make sure you cover the basic feel and genre of type of game play (FPS, RPG, RTS). The spine and the objectives are where you will win or lose most of your readers. And you should be as strong and clear as possible in stating the opening of your design document.
  3. You can also incorporate some of the more striking and important art that you've created for the game here in the intro. But briefly, so perhaps one or two illustrations that really support the spine and the objective.

#### Detailed Game Overview
  4. Take us through the game, start to finish, adds a rough chronology of
the story with an idea of how this is presented in the game.
This, of course, uses the story synopsis we've written mixed in with bits
of the story presentation scheme.

Using the shooter from last week as an example,
*We start with a pre-rendered cut-scene
animation in the main office of the League of Shooters.
Where our hero Jake, walks in to sign up for this year's competition.
Then we start the game-play with the first competition
where we are in first-person shooting mode.
Picture-in-picture windows cut in and out through a heads-up chat display as Emily,
a contestant in the first round with Jake, talks with him as they shoot.*
Here we learn that Jake has lost his family and
that Deadeye Jane is etc.

This process is sometimes also explained very well by creating a game flowchart.
Which we'll explore a little bit later.

Why write these as separate documents, if in the design document you merge them together?
  * It's a lot easier to design the story of your game if you
are able to focus on one aspect at a time and then moving on to thinking about how the game presents that story.
  * Plus it allows you to have a lot of different iterations and the chance to develop the idea more and more with each separate document that you create. There's a lot of power to that.

Finally, wrap up your intro with a couple of paragraphs that speak to the gameplay aspects of your game. This is the core of your gameplay, and should be discussed here,
along with any deviations or changes or twists that you plan on in that gameplay.

## Diving Deeper into the Design Document
Now that in the first few pages of the design document we've created
a wonderful introduction to the game, we can move on to the rest of the document.
Here, a lot of templates vary and
offer different opinions on how things should be presented.

  5. I believe it's probably best to insert a few paragraphs on how you see the artistic style of your game as a whole. This should describe the look and feel of your game (Cartoony, photo-real, cute little icons). You should back up your writing with just a few examples of your illustrations, or art references to show what you're going for in terms of style. Now, style, think about it, covers not only the environment and characters, but also the look and feel of your interface, your game menus and sound, too.  Don't show off all of your artwork here. It's just to show the overall style of your game.
  6. Next for your design document, since you have laid out a story synopsis already,
you would do very well to present your characters now. Here you're gonna use the character brief and lists that you created for your main characters, along with any of the design artwork that you've created for them in the game. These can be presented nicely, next to each other, so that each character brief is accompanied by artwork showing that character off. Obviously, you start with your hero, your protagonist, and then move on to your villain, the antagonist, and then move on to a handful of the major characters that play a big role in your game.
  7. After this should come the settings, and their descriptions, your environment, and the artwork that comes along with that. Same as with the characters. Here you want to start with the primary, or most important location, and then move onto the others, showing that artwork that you've created. 
  8. If items like vehicles and weapons and so on are important in the game,
you should really consider also including some descriptions of those here as well.
For example, does your hero drive a special car in your game, and
if so, what is it? What is the history of this special car and what's it look like? Use much the same considerations for the character and settings descriptions as we've laid out before. 

But don't go overboard describing everything in your game. You're not presenting a full asset list, just the creative design choices that you've made for the more important aspects of your game to define the style.

  9. Now, after you've established the creative aspects of your game, and given your reader a valuable insight into your idea, the rest of the design document, can lay out the more mechanical and pragmatic choices for the game. For instance, describing the interface (how the game loads, platforms), and the controls (keyboard, touch) the player will have over your game. Describe your interface clearly and how we interact with it as people. Basically, you wanna define how the player uses the game at all physical levels. Are there any online components? How does multiplayer work, if it does at all?

 ## Gameplay Flowcharts

We have described the chronology of the game and its story from start to finish. We have also described how the gameplay works to create an exciting and playable game in a few pages in our Detailed Game Overview for the beginning of a Game Design Document. This should hook the reader into the game and give them a great idea of what you want to produce.

Making an additional document that graphically lays the basics of this overview out is a good way to bolster your material. You can do this using a basic gameplay flowchart, which charts the gameplay from beginning to end. We don’t need to rehash the storyline with this chart, and can focus more on how the game actually unfolds at a more mechanical level.

This flowchart also outlines the options in the game, and how the player navigates the gameplay from beginning to the end. This flowchart goes hand in hand with the Story Presentation Scheme, but, again, shows its structure rather than rehashing the same information.

In relation to the story, it shows how the narrative can turn and twist, and how the gameplay could give the player options and choices within that scope.

You can use this format to not only inform your design document reader how you see your game unfold, but also as a concrete blueprint to design your game. It easily shows how cut-scene cinematics and gameplay work together to advance the overall story.

## Turning The Shooter's Story into a Game
Okay, let's get back to workshopping what we started last week and
get the shooter story better defined as a game.
You have a story all set up and running really nicely in a synopsis.
And you've got a strong grasp on who your characters are and where they all exist.
In that design document, we talked about describing your game play.
This is at the heart of your game obviously, and
that game play is what gets your story out to the player.
The first thing to do here is to take a look at your story and
how you're figuring out showing that story off.
Along the same lines,
you wanna gamify your story by taking the important parts of your story synopsis.
And putting them into an interactive way of making those points.

So let's gamify the shooter, keeping in mind all the points we've learned so
far on rising the action.
And using as much of the gameplay and
game characters as we can in exposing that story.
This basically maps out how to create your game flowchart as well.
 * the Shooter's gameplay centers on levels of shooting challenges.
 * It starts with a simple target shoot-out at level one, right after he signs up for
the competition.
Here is where those settings, those idea sheets come in handy.
 * In the first arena, we are in a shooting range with multiple lanes.
Now, should we jump right into shooting?
As the game designer, think about the human player and what kinds of choices and
decisions that you want them to make to keep them interacting.
Since this is a shooting competition,
having a choice of weapons is an absolute no brainer.
  * Have the player controlling Jake and selecting a range of level one weapons to control with, simple handguns, nothing too flashy.
As you wanna increase the coolness of these things, as you rise the action and
the difficulty of the game play. Now each weapon can have its pluses and
minuses that respond to how your player likes to play. Your imagination can run wild here, as long as you leave enough room to grow. And stay true to the rising actions of the game and the story. 
  * Now, we would write, once the player picks picks the weapon from a list,
they lead Jake into the shooting range and into his own lane.
The characters have earphones and eye protection with heads up displays projected on the goggles at each lane. 
  * We can see Jake put on the earphones and the glasses and step into a shooting lane. And then our game camera slides into first person mode, where we see Jake's hands in front of him, holding his chosen weapon.
  * The targets turn in front of them and we begin firing at the targets using mouse and keyboard combinations.
  * All the while, during the shooting, the goggles will display information on their heads up display. A status of sorts. 
  * Other contestants may actually pop into that display with friendly taunts and comments as the players continue to shoot.
The distraction of these heads up display character chats can be part of the gameplay itself.
Requiring the human player to absorb as much information about the story line as they can.
To be helpful to them later on as they play the game. Jake could get hints and
tips from his old friends as he's shooting in the competition.
You can even program these hints and taunts as difficulty levels in your game.
Where taunting is at a minimum and the advice is really helpful for beginner players.
And more advanced players can get more distracting taunts, and perhaps even bad advice on the heads up display.
The more of these story details that you work into your story, the more you're gonna have to use in your game play. To make these things interesting and fun.
  * As these targets are hit, they turn away and new ones pop in place. The player must hit within the center two rings on all targets within the time allotted to beat this level. As well as score higher than the other contestants. 
  * The top 8 players with the highest scores will then move on to the next round of shooting in Arena 2.

Now, I won't belabour the point any longer here, but this type of format is great for
getting across everything that you've developed in your story synopsis.
And your presentation scheme into this cohesive detail game overview.
That you can use at the beginning of your game design document.
It tell us the story, as well as the game play,
as it takes us chronologically through the game play itself.


## The Shooter's Rising Gameplay
Now let's discuss how we can keep this gameplay rising,
as we do with the story's actions and its tensions.
As an example, let's walk through the shooter, level by level.
  * **Level 2:** After the first level, we know that each round of the competition gets tougher, and that Jake will have a harder and harder time beating each of these levels before the big death match with Dead-Eye Jane at the end. 
We could just make the targets smaller, and put them further away from the shooter with each level.  It is true that smaller targets are gonna be harder to hit, but think of the player here, would it be more exciting? 

After the player beats the first level, we cut into cinematic cut scene sequence where we see some of Jake's past comrades congratulating him on the win and how they're glad to see him back, exposing more of the story of him and his family's loss. He's touched, but he's eager to move on, thinking nothing of the greater conspiracy to come.

The second gameplay level has The Shooter shooting at moving targets with a selection of cooler, more capable weapons to balance out the tougher arena in this level. Not only are the target circles smaller, but the targets also move up, down, and side to side in each of the shooting lanes. 

And then you go on to describe how Jake meets another competitor, Emily, in the second level. And we start hearing about Dead-Eye Jane through the heads-up display chats. And of course, after this shooting gameplay, it is an opportunity for another cut scene to give out more story before we go on to Level 3, which you would describe in this text, of course.

Now also with this harder gameplay at this Level 2, the perspective of the human player gets challenged. And their ability to use the mouse and keyboard controls has got to improve to be able to beat the level, to advance to the third level where we're gonna see Jake competing alongside an old confidant, Phil, where he learns more about Dead-Eye Jane being a crook.

  * **Level 3:** We need to make this third level harder to play, but add new weapons and ammo to help keep the game in balance. 

In the detailed game overview we could start writing something like: In the elite third round of gameplay, our arena is designed to be immersive. The players don't just stand in lanes to shoot at moving targets, they are inside the shooting range itself.
Each character, including Jake the player, takes timed turns
shooting targets inside a room where targets drop in from the ceiling and
spring up from the floor all around the player.

Here we see a shift in the core first-person gameplay, and
introduce a third-person view as the player now
gets to control the movement of the shooter inside the arena space.
Targets are much more surprising on this level, and are faster and harder to hit.
Using audio cues, we can have targets come up behind the shooter,
forcing the player to have to turn, jump, duck and
maneuver their way around the shooting course.

Scoring is as before, based on time and accuracy,
with only the top four shooters advancing to the semi-finals.
And you just keep this momentum going as you design your gameplay.
  * Keep asking yourself, how do I make it more challenging?
  * How do I keep the game in balance?
  * How do I keep it exciting and engaging for the player?
This level that we just talked about not only made the game more interesting, but
it twisted on the core gameplay and got us out of that familiar first-person shooting
mode and has the player controlling more than just that perspective.
This all works in tandem as well with the rising stakes at this part of the story,
which have gotten pretty high at this point.
We know Dead-Eye Jane is a cheater, and
she's power hungry and is the real antagonist in this story.


  * **Level 4** is where Jake in our story is going to be shooting against a few
of Dead-Eye Jane's henchmen, including Patrick.
So we would write something like this: The fourth gameplay level has The Shooter shooting shifting targets from a moving vehicle in a new outdoor arena.
The player chooses from a new lineup of assault rifles and submachine guns, as well as a vehicle to control during the competition. A topless jeep, a motocross bike, or a magnetic levitation board. 

During this gameplay, we meet Patrick, one of Jane's henchmen. And then you go on to describe the gameplay level and how it's beaten and how it leads to a new cut scene where we see that Jake learns from Patrick that Dead-Eye Jane is actually the one who caused the accident that took his family's life. This is, of course, if the player manages to beat Patrick in that level.

This last level we talked about is also another opportunity to twist on the core gameplay and go from being in first-person shooting mode to that third-person mode, where you have to control not only the aiming and the shooting, but also drive the moving vehicle. This elevates the gameplay as the story gets tenser, and gives the player more motivation to keep trying to beat that level.

  * **Level 5**: Now knowing the stakes are as high as they can get, that Jane killed Jake's family and has rigged the final arena against him into this death match, hoping to actually kill Jake. We're coming to the last level in the game itself, and the final crisis of the story. So this gameplay must be adequately difficult and engaging.

Our overview would then read something like this. The fifth and final level of the shootout competition is where Jake squares off with Dead-Eye Jane herself. Both players start at opposite sides of a large maze arena that has targets that pop in and out all around the characters.

These targets are also armed with Taser pistols that stun the players as they progress through the maze. A player, when stunned, loses time and the chance to score on targets, but
also is prone to being ambushed by the other player in the maze. Because this is a death match, as we learned in the preceding cut scene, the player's ammunition is live and deadly.
And again, the overview would describe how the level plays out, and how the player can defeat Jane and set off the final cut scene of the game that resolves the story.

Of course, that is, if the player can actually beat Jane.
Otherwise they get a very different cut scene with Jake being carted off
on a stretcher to the morgue.
