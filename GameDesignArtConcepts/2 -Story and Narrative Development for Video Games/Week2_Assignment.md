## Submission

### Title
Animal Farm: A Fairy Story by George Orwell

### Write the Spine (logline) of your chosen story or film here. 
This book is about a group of farm animals that revolt against the human exploitation hoping for more dignified and egalitarian life on the farm and the difficulties that they are confronted with afterwards. After expelling the humans and taking over the farm in a revolt led by the pigs, the animals are faced with difficulties that lead them to split into two factions: a modernizing faction led by Snowball and a totalitarian faction led by Napoleon. Snowball and Napoleon oppose each other until the Napoleon manages to gain the upper-hand, chasing Snowball out of the farm by force and purging it from his opponents, ultimately establishing a more unequal and class-cased farm-system to the point that he other animals can't tell the difference between the pigs and the humans anymore.

### Write the synopsis of your story here (200-400 words). Try to hit all 8 points of a good synopsis.
Animal farm is an allegory about a group of farm animals that revolt against the human exploitation and the difficulties that are confronted with, based on the key events Soviet Union and the rise of Stalin.

All the story takes place at an unspecified time on a British farm called the Manor Farm, owned by Mr. Jones. The story is focused on the activities on the farm, rendering the setting mostly irrelevant, except for a few cultural references. At this farm, we follow a group of animals (protagonists), particularly the actions of the pigs and how these impact the other animals. We follow the pigs as they were responsible for carrying the vision of the old boar Major, who dreamed of the day the animals would reject their slavery and rebel against mankind (antagonists). This revolution is the inciting incident of the story, setting the pigs as the supervisors of the revolution, leading the other animals on the newly named Animal Farm. This incident, the animal revolution, leads to all the confrontations.

Even though Mr. Jones (mankind) is initially presented as the "real enemy" and the antagonist, being the cause for all the oppression of the farm animals and an ever-present opposing force, the main antagonist is revealed to be one of the pigs, Napoleon, who opposes the principles of the animal revolution for his own gain. The main protagonist is thus Snowball, the idealist and eloquent pig who strives to improve the conditions of all animals in the farm, remaining true to the the principle that "All animals are equal".

Snowball's overarching goal is to see the revolution succeed, but the immediate goal is to solve the animal problems, particularly by planning for the future by modernizing (building an electric windmill) the farm, allowing the animals better work and live conditions. However, Napoleon is greedy and selfish and sees the current situation as an opportunity to take the power for himself and the other pigs. These two character oppose in various issues over how to lead the farm, splitting the animals into two factions, which gives rise to the story conflict. At stake for both of these characters is the future of the revolution, their visions for it and their position/reputation in the animal's society. Snowball needs to make his ideas stand so the animals can improve their lives, while Napoleon has to "catch up" with his more competent and liked rival, so he does not lose his opportunity.

The action rises trough a number of arguments between Snowball and Napoleon, with intermittent attempts of Mr. Jones to retake the farm leading to more heated confrontations between the two pigs, all the while the animal's situation gets more dire as the implemented solutions do not improve the farm as expected. This leads to the final crisis, which occurs over the windmill construction project. At this point, the strengths of both characters are played to their fullest: Snowball give an inspiring speech on how the sacrifices of today will lead to the betterment of tomorrow and Napoleon grunts. Even though grunting is not inspirational, it was a signal that revealed Napoleons long planning and cunning: he has been secretly "educating" his dogs not according to the revolutionary principles but as mindless beasts ("state police"), who ferociously chase Snowball out of the farm.

After the final crisis between the protagonist Snowball and the antagonist Napoleon occurs, the story goes on resolving how the farm rules change and how the revolution principles progressively change through an intensive campaign of propaganda, misinformation and, later on, active purges. Trade with humans ("the enemy") is reestablished, the pigs form an elite class of animals and the farm is ultimately renamed Manor Farm, leading to the new law that "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others".

### Write a character brief for the protagonist of your story (150-300 words). Try to hit all 6 points of what makes a good character description.
Snowball is a primary character in the story, and the main protagonist (in the perspective of the revolution). However, he is defeated in the final crisis by Napolean, the main antagonist.
Snowball is an essential character in the book as he is one of the leaders of the revolution and the establishment of the Animal Farm. Thus his actions lead to the inciting incident after which he will lead the animals in a direction that directly brings him into confrontation with Napoleon.

The character' physical description is not of consequence in this particular story, but Snowball is an intelligent, passionate and eloquent pig. These traits and his idealism make him the natural and loved leader of the revolution after old Major's dead, and his persuasive nature captures the imagination and dedication of the other animals, even those that initially doubt the revolution. However, this focus on logic and rhetorical skill to gain his influence will prove his downfall when the final crisis occurs.

Snowball is one of the oppressed animals that rebels against their human master and his relation with the other characters results from their shared experiences. Snowball takes on a role of teacher and guide for the other animals, helping them to adapt to the new Farm and to improve their lives, but strongly opposes any human. His motivation is to see the old Major's vision of an Utopian farm where all animals are equal.

### Write a character brief for the antagonist of your story (150-300 words). Try to hit all 6 points of what makes a good character description.
Napoleon is a primary character in the story and the main antagonist (from the perspective of the revolution).

Napoleon is an essential character in the book as he is one of the leaders of the revolution and establishment of the Animal Farm. Thus his actions lead to the inciting incident after which he will lead the pigs in a direction that directly bring him into confrontation with Snowball.

The character' physical description is not of consequence in this particular story, but Napoleon is crafty, treacherous opportunist, who made little contribution to the early revolution, but sees himself, and the pigs, as the smartest animals and thus natural leaders of the farm. He is not able to persuade the other animals with great speeches and inspire them to believe in a better future like Snowball. Despite that, his schemes lead him to discredit Snowball and take control the Animal Farm, ruling with lies and force, being ultimately victorious.

Napoleon is one of the oppressed animals that rebel against their human master and his relation with the other animals results from their shared experiences. However, he is a constant source of disagreement and mistrust, opposed to Snowball's unifying influence. His motivation is the betterment of his situation with disregard to that of all other animals.

### OPTIONAL: Write a Setting Description (100-300 words) that outlines the major locations/levels (2-3 maximum) and, in your proposed game, how a character might travel from place to place. 
There is only one location in the story: Manor Farm. It is poorly described as to maintain the "fairy tale" and "allegory" idea that the story does not refer to a specific farm (if to a farm at all!) but to something more general. There are however, parts of the farm that are mentioned, such as the Farmhouse, where Mr. Jones (the non-worker elite) lived, a place of exclusion of the animals; and the Barn, a place of work and shelter which becomes the central meeting place for the animals after the revolution and where the laws of Animal Farm are written for all to see. There are two other neighboring farms mentioned, Foxwood and Pinchfield. Foxwood is a neglected, run-down farm with clumsy owners and Pinchfield is a smaller but better maintained farm. These farms are never visited and represent the "international" farms and are used to convey the "political" setting throughout the book.
