# Week 1: An Introduction to Story
For the first week of the class, we will be analyzing the components of three-act structure using a classic fairytale as an example. We'll examine the characters in the story by figuring out their goals and the main conflict that creates a rising arc of action to keep the audience interested.

###Glossary of Terms:

Spine: The logline or one sentence description of your story

Story Synopsis: A full summary of a story describing the journey of the main character, his or her goals, the conflict that arises, and how that conflict is resolved.

Character Brief: A description of a character in a story or game. It may include physical description, backstory, and details about their involvement in the story.

Setting Description: An overview of a location in a story or game

Idea Sheet: A list of ideas created from a free-writing or brainstorm exercise

Presentation Scheme: A document that outlines the game story through the gameplay

Gameplay Overview: A description of how the story of a game is revealed through gameplay and cut-scene animations.

Gameplay Flowchart: A visual map of a game's story

## What makes a story compelling?

A good story, basically put, takes you on a journey. Through the eyes of the characters, you watch them experience their circumstances, taking action, and making decisions that will affect how the story unfolds. When you're engaged in a compelling story, you've just gotta see how it unfolds, and what's gonna happen. But basically, in a story, the reader is a passive participant. You're either reading, or watching what's happening and
seeing how the story unfolds, as it's being told to you.
When you the reader become active in this event,
you create the idea of an interactive story. 
You're presented with decisions to determine how the story unfolds.
Interacting with a storyline can be fun,
and really engage you into being more active like you would in a game.
This real time decision making process is the basis
of a lot of games that we know and love today.
But behind it is that fantastically animated,
well-designed story and its characters.
That's the draw of the game.
It's not about standing at the arcade console throwing money into the box,
moving the joystick up and
down, it's about watching this knight fulfill his mission.
It's about the story.


## How games benefit from stories

There's a lot of ways games can benefit from traditional story lines.
When you see your game design first as a story,
you're gonna begin attaching emotion to it.
  * Stories create emotinal attachements between its characters and players



The game pieces become characters that you connect and empathize with.
This bond that exists between a reader and his or
her book, is a bond that you can easily create in a game.

So now, your player not only bonds with the game on the super cool, fun and
exciting game play level, where you run and shoot and jump and duck and all that,
but also at at emotional level where the player actually cares about
the game piece because it feels like a person, maybe even a friend.

  * Stories can otivate a designer to finish a game project

Another reason why it's important to see your game as a story first, in my opinion,
is that it gives you more of a motivation to actually finish your project.

Let me tell you this story.
A group of some of the best CG students I had quite a few years ago,
came to me one day and told me about this awesome animation they were gonna produce.
They told me, dude, it's gonna be about this
really awesome looking robot that wakes up in this huge factory.
And he suddenly becomes self-aware and he unplugs himself and starts
running through this place and takes all these weapons out that are built into him.
And he's gonna start jumping and kicking and
shooting and going through all these obstacles.
And they're like the action is gonna be mad.
Awesome, I said.
Sounds like a lot of fun.
But then I asked them a question that stumped them, what's the robot's name?

Why did the robot become self-aware?
Who made the robot?
Why is he fighting out of this factory?
What's his goal basically, and basically who's this character that we're watching?
Who's this robot?

Well, the students just kinda roll their eyes and basically said whatever,
that doesn't matter.
But I warned them that without some sort of back story,
without a deeper understanding of the characters and the whys of this animation,
it's just gonna end up being another thing to watch and forget about on YouTube.
It's gonna lack emotional connection.
And mostly, the group of students would probably get tired of the hard
work that's needed for this and end up walking away and
never finishing it, which unfortunately they never did finish.

  * The more personally invested you are in the creation of your game, the more life you can breath into it; the more motivation to see it through. 
My point then, and my point now, is that the more personally invested you are in
the creation of your story your game, the more life you can breathe into it,
the more motivation you're gonna have to see it through.

Seeing your game as a story helps you get to that bond.
As a matter of fact, the more of yourself and
your own life experience you can write into the characters and
into the story line of your game, the stronger this bond is gonna be.
The game also becomes an extension of your perspective.

  * Your personal story in a game can give you a voice to speak through.
It gives you a voice to speak through.
You should never discount that level of attachment to a creative process.
Lastly, why I feel it's important to see your game as a story first,
is that a story is gonna help build you a framework for your game start to finish.
By understanding the mechanics of how a story comes together and how it's told,
you can help yourself design a game idea much more fruitfully.

  * Stories help build a framework into a game.
A story will help tie the various design elements and choices all together.
Whenever you're faced with a design question, you simply turn to the story
you've designed first and ask yourself, does this serve my story?
Just take a look at Angry Birds.
Here we've got a light,
whimsical game where you flick birds at pigs to try to knock them over.
Every inch of that game ties together tightly.
The game's storyline gives you a sense of a world that exists where these birds and
pigs live together, that they deserve your emotional attention.
The story's simple.
Pigs steal eggs from the birds, birds get angry and they fight back and
try to get their eggs.
And every level that you play fits into that simple storyline.
It's not about knocking these pigs over, so
much as it is about getting the bird's eggs back and righting a wrong.
See?
Now you're emotionally vested in helping the birds get their eggs.
As silly as that sounds, it's true.
You can't deny that that is more powerful than just flicking random
shapes across the screen to knock into other random shapes on the other side.
The story of the pigs and
birds becomes a higher purpose that you can connect with as a player.

## How to see a game as a story first

  * Protagonist: In a traditional story the hero is called the protagonist.
  This is the character that's primarily responsible for driving the plot of the story.
  He's gotta accomplish a mission.
  * Antagonist: The opposing force that stands in that hero's way is called the antagonist. This character is responsible for creating, conflict, basically complicating the protagonists quest in getting whatever he or she is out to achieve.

This is central to a story, as well as to a game.
You need that source of conflict between these two opposing desires or goals.
That's your emotional context.
So seeing your game as a story first will help you not only easier define
these two opposing forces, but also assign emotion and character to them.
This not only sets you up with a what your game is about, but
also helps you define why you should connect to it at a more personal level.


Try looking at your game's hero in that protagonist context, and
try to see the forces that stand in their way as the antagonist.
Seeing them as characters, as living beings that have emotions.
Start your game's story by defining that emotional relationship
between these two forces.
  
  * What's their history?
  * Why is one opposed to the other?
  * What does each side stand to gain or lose?

These are all the things that we look for in a good story, and
I think these should be things that we all look for in good games, too.


It's not enough to just connect emotionally with the player or audience.
You need to keep that interest level rising as your story or game unfolds.
This brings up the idea of **rising actions** in a story,
which we're gonna analyze more thoroughly in following lectures.
Rising actions basically means the energy of your story
needs to keep increasing from the beginning through to the end.
The conflicts between the protagonist and
the antagonist forces need to develop and the tensions between them
need to keep rising until they finally resolve at the end in one big event.
The story's hero needs to run into trouble that gets worse, and worse, before finally being able to complete his goals.
We see a very tight correlation to what keeps a game interesting, and that
is in seeing a game get harder and harder to play as you work up in its levels.
So the player of the game has got to get better at playing as they go along,
but we need balance.
So to balance out that game play,
designers also created new functions, skill and characters that help get around these harder obstacles and
give the player something new to learn and master in their game play.
Much in the same way that stories present **plot twists**, and increase tensions,
and more increasing, dangerous situations for the hero to overcome.

So, in a nut shell, seeing your game first as a story becomes a strong,
conceptual blueprint.
And off of that blueprint you can design the characters, the settings, and
the game play to fit into and tell that story,
whether you have a simple game or you have a super, huge, complex game.
It's the story that elevates the game and
appeals to the player in that most important way.


## Story Synopsis: Sleeping Beauty

Learning how to see the elements of narrative in existing stories will guide you in understanding how story structure is used and help you create your own stories.

Here we summarize the Disney version of Sleeping Beauty to show you how you can begin to find the "beats" of story structure, such as rising actions, in a traditional three-act structure. We'll examine this concept more closely in an upcoming lecture. Please read the following synopsis to familiarize yourself with Sleeping Beauty, as we will be referring to it this week.

## Defining the Spine

Whether you've got a short story that's maybe a couple pages, or
like a super huge epic that's maybe like thousands of pages,
there needs to be a single theme to that story.
Personally, I like to call that a **spine**, also known as **logline** or a **throughline**.

A spine of a story is the primary theme of what the story is about,
what it's basically trying to say at its core.
I strongly believe that a story teller should be able to distill their story into
one or two sentences to communicate the overall feel of the story,
to say, what's important to walk away with when you're reading that story.

Now, it's important to have a spine, because the story designer has a central
concept to make sure all the elements of his or her story serve that concept.
If a character, or a scene, or
some dialogue doesn't move the plot forward in that spine,
then it really should be cut or changed to stay on track.
So, to be better able to communicate the spine of your story, we should see how
to identify spines first and the best way to do this, honestly, is through practice.

As you can imagine, different people will see different spines,
but they should all reasonably be about the same.
The spine theory does apply to games, too.
Having a spine for your game gives you the same focus and
framework as it does for making a traditional story.
Any game player or graphic, or
cinematic that doesn't serve that spine should really be cut or
changed to make sure the game is conceptually tight and focused.
So as you set out to eventually write out your own stories and games,
make sure to give a lot of consideration to that central theme of your tale and
how to distill that story into a concise one or two sentence spine.

## Three-Act Structure and Rising Action

Understanding story structure is really gonna help you create your own stories.
Most traditional stories are told through what's called the three-act structure.

  * We begin with Act 1, which is called the set up. 
  Here we introduce the major characters involved in the story, usually the protagonist and the antagonist forces. We also set up the world, or setting, in which the story takes place, or at least where it begins. Act 1 ends with what's called the **inciting incident**. This is the event in the beginning of a story that sets off the primary conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist. And it also defines and gets the hero's quest up and running.  
  * Moving on to Act 2, often called the confrontation, this act is where all the action of the conflict plays out. And we see a rise in tensions. We see a rise in action as the obstacles facing the hero become more and more dire, until we get to the end of Act 2 where there's the final conflict, in which these two opposing forces finally begin to resolve that conflict. This Act 2 is usually the longest part of the story, and it's where the idea of rising action is most seen. Each event that happens in Act 2 should build upon the last and create more tension and more danger of the hero failing their quest. 
  This keeps us engaged and always questioning, what's gonna happen? 
  The final crisis, and this ends Act 2.
  * Finally, there's Act 3, often called the resolution. In this act, a good story will resolve the conflict in a super satisfying way for the audience. Usually this is when we see the hero vanquish the villain in this ultimate fight, and finally claim what is rightfully theirs. Justice.

Understanding this narrative three-act structure
really helps you to find the story behind your game.
But it also helps to find the arc of your game, how it starts and
where it goes and how it ends.
Basically how does it play out from start to finish?
So how do we define this structure in terms of a game?
