# Week 2: Game Story Structure

In this week, we will draw a parallel between last week’s discussion on rising action and how that relates to gameplay. Looking at a pair of contemporary games, we'll learn how to identify story structure and themes of rising action, just like we would with traditional stories and movies. Lastly, we’ll evaluate the role that primary and secondary characters come to play in the unveiling of a game’s story and discuss the importance of understanding how these games present their stories in the actual gameplay.


## Writing Your Own Story Synopsis

So now, let's take a look at how you can begin to summarize your own stories
into a synopsis on your way to making it again.
First of all, what's a story synopsis?
Well, it's a summary of the story line in paragraph form.
It lays out the spine of the story.
It introduces and tells us about the characters involved, and
what they do throughout that story.
It also sets the tone and
the pace of the story, as you want to tell, it in a concise document,
that can be maybe a few paragraphs long to a maximum of a couple of pages.
The story synopsis summarizes the story best, I believe,
using the three act structure,
setting up where important points of the structure happen in your story.
  * what's the inciting incident?
  * How does the action escalate?
  * What's the final crisis?
  * How does the resolution come?
So as you summarize your story, think of the three act structure.
Think of that framework in defining the beginning, the middle, and the end.
For a proper synopsis, try to tell us the following eight points.
  1. where are we? Where does the story take place?
  2. who are we following? Who is the protagonist and why is it them?
  3. who or what force is opposed to that protagonist? Who stands in the way of the hero? That's the antagonist, and, importantly, why? Why are they standing in the way?
  4. what do these characters what to accomplish? What's at stake for them?
  5. what's the ensuing conflict, and why does it exist?
  6. how does the action rise?How do you keep things moving, and getting more tense as you go along?
  7. what's the final crisis, and how does it play out?
  8. How do things resolve? How do they wrap up?

So, summarizing a deep story driven game like that into a couple of pages,
for a synopsis, does make sense, but
how do you create a story synopsis for a much simpler game?
This starts with the story's spine..
From that spine you embellish and you fill out the story, and
you make the major point of what happens, as you progress throughout the game.
Break it down into the framework of the three act structure.


## Defining Characters and Character Goals

Characters. They're the driving force of any story or game.
Characters are who we see the game through.
They are our portal into the story of the game world.
The better we understand who a character is,
the more engaged we are with the underlying story.
It's important to understand how to use characters to propel your game and
connect to the player.
So I challenge you, and especially those of you who wanna design
non-story games, to think of all your
game pieces as characters that have personality, emotion, and life.


Let's talk about the primary character, the protagonist,
which we know is essentially the hero of a story that drives the plot forward.
It's through the hero's perspective that you relate to the circumstances of
the story, so you should ideally understand him or her the most.
Furthermore, in a game, the hero is typically the character you also control.

So when you create your own characters, you should always arm them with goals,
both immediate and the wider character goals.
Immediate goals are challenges and hurdles that they must overcome
during the action of the game play, during the game story.

Character goals are those where the character's actively or
even subconsciously reaching for a longer term objective.
A want that they have, like personal redemption or finding a true love.
All of their actions are then guided by this longer-term character goal and
help define who the character is.
And their immediate goals and actions should really support that.

The same can be send of the antagonist character.
They too must have immediate goals.
Usually in direct opposition to the hero, actively so,
because they have something to gain from foiling the hero.

The key here is that the hero and the villain have an existing and
opposing character goals, bringing back to light what we've talked about before,
creating an emotional connection between the protagonist and antagonist and
building your story to exploit that.


Think of that framework in defining the beginning, the middle, and the end.
So the more story-driven your game is, the more you wanna think about
your characters beyond the scope of the immediate game, to create lives for them
that reach beyond the limits, and help define their motivations as living beings.
With simple arcade games, it's much simpler to state these
character goals, since there's only a very simple cartoonish narrative to the game,
but it's still important to know what these goals are.

What creates a deeper character for these game pieces is also in their design and
their individual game capabilities.

Define your character as deeply as possible and give them wants and
needs that go beyond the scope of your immediate game to help motivate
their actions and their personas in the game.


## Using Secondary Characters

Throughout a story we, typically, encounter other characters.
We don't usually just focus solely on the hero and the villain.
Even though it's their conflict that drives the plot of a story,
you should use secondary characters to help facilitate that story, and
all the things that happen.


You, as the game designer,
have several ways of presenting the player with how to get to the goal.
You could simply put a signpost at the gates of the village that point
which way the cave is. But, that's too easy, and it's just kinda boring.
This is where using a secondary character can increase the excitement of your game.
Let's say instead of that sign,
the player meets another character in front of a tavern in that village.
You now have an opportunity to create an interaction between these characters,
that's gonna be more engaging than reading a simple sign, and
moving her left or right.

Now, let's take that a little further, and
build that part of the story into the gameplay itself.
What if you design the game where the player would have to search out clues to find out how to get this information to get to the cave? They would need to go inside the tavern and
seek out one of the patrons at the bar that may know where the cave is.
You've made the gameplay more interesting by requiring action
from the player to expose the next part of your story.

Especially in story driven games,
you need a lot of these characters to present plot points and
plot twists, that help drive the story, and keep the actions rising.

So once you have thought of your game's spine, and
you've been able to summarize your story line, and
you've settled on how your primary characters drive the story,
your next task is to think of the secondary characters that fill out and
help tell that story.

## Writing a Character Brief

So, the best way to go about quantifying your characters,
primary and secondary, is by creating a character list and
character descriptions or briefs that communicate who these people are and
how they fit into the game story, how are they being used?
You would of course begin by listing and describing the primary characters.
Those are the ones responsible for the main action of the game.
And then by moving on to the secondary characters, what they bring to the table,
how they propel your story.
As far as the descriptions go,
We would describe them in terms of the following points.
  1.Who is he? Or who is she? Are they a primary or a secondary character and how do they relate to the game story?
  2.What do they look like? What are they wearing? What are they carrying with them. How do they comport themselves.
  3.What is their personality like and how does that personality help fulfill their role in the game story?
  4.How do they relate to other characters in the game? How does that ecology work?
  5.What are their strengths, and what are their weaknesses, and how can that affect the game's story?
  6.What are the motivating character goals for this character.

Now, the descriptions like this for the primary characters are more involved and
detailed than they would be for secondary characters like Bart.
When it comes to goals and strengths and weaknesses since these points
affect the story line directly through the primary characters.
But on the whole, these character lists and
briefs help you as the designer drive your game story.
But they will also serve to communicate to other designers
how to visualise those characters for you.
Whether you take on the role of creating the art yourself or
you have somebody else take on that role, these descriptions go a super
duper long way in painting a picture of what these characters look like.
But be sure to be concise and descriptive, and try to think of the primary characters
beyond the scope of the game at hand for a deeper, richer character description.

### Understanding who your characters are is important to understanding your story and your game. In this lecture, we will take a closer look at the primary characters in StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty and break down their characters as exercise. Namely, we'll be making character lists and character briefs to describe who is in the story and what they do.

To create your character briefs keep the following six points in mind:

    Who is he/she? Are they a primary or secondary character and how do they relate to the game story?
    What do they look like? What are they wearing or carrying with them?
    What is their personality like and how does that personality help fulfill their role in the game story?
    How do they relate to other characters in the game?
    What are their strengths and weaknesses, and how can that affect the game story?
    What are the motivating character goals for this character?
### About Setting Descriptions

Just as listing and describing your characters is important for a design document, so is presenting your settings and environments.

In these examples, we will take a closer look at the primary settings that we will include in our Game Design Document later.

By outlining these ideas and settings in written form, we'll learn how the game creator can aid the designers and give a better overview of the world to readers of the Game Design document.

Create your settings description briefs with the following points in mind:

    Where are we?
    What does this place have to do with the game story?
    How does this place relate to the characters?
    Where did we come from and where does this place lead?
    What does this setting look like?
