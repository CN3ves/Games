## Assignment 

Pick a popular story or movie that you are very familiar with. For example, you might choose a fairytale (try to choose something other than Sleeping Beauty, for practice) or a film you watched recently or many times as a child. Choose a story or film you need not read or watch again for the purposes of this assignment. 

(Note: You will be encouraged to revisit this same story or film for the assignment in Week 2.)

For this assignment, you are asked to submit three things: 

    * The Spine (logline) of the story
    * A breakdown of the story into three acts. Your answer should consist of three paragraphs describing the actions of each act and how they rise and culminate to a resolution. (200-400 words)
    * A statement that describes your interest to this story/movie, or rather: Why does this story matter to you? 

Use the title of the story or film as your project title, and submit!


## Submission

### Title
Animal Farm: A Fairy Story by George Orwell

### Write the Spine (logline) of your chosen story or film here. 
This book is about a group of farm animals that revolt against the human exploitation hoping for more dignified and egalitarian life on the farm. After expelling the humans and taking over the farm, the animals are faced with difficulties that lead them splitting into two factions: a modernizing faction and a totalitarian faction. These factions oppose each other until the totalitarian faction gains the upper-hand, resulting into the establishment of a more unequal and class-cased farm-system, similar to that of the humans (you can think that the antagonist wins or that the protagonist is an anti-hero!).

### Break your story or film down using three-act structure. Your answer should consist of three paragraphs describing the actions of each act and how they rise and culminate to a resolution. (200-40 words total)

The story is broken into the three-act structure as follows:

    1. Setting: The live of the farm animals is introduced, particularly how the humans are the force behind the animals exploitation and misery. The dream for a more equal society at the farm is introduced leading to the inciting incident: the hosting of the humans and the establishment a fairer animal society.
    2. Confrontation: After the revolution, the animals need to learn how to manage the farm and are confronted with numerous challenges, particularly the human attempts are reclaiming the farm. These attacks lead to a split in the animal's leaderships, building tension and building up the rise in action until one of the factions is victorious and consolidates its position.
    3. Resolution: Once the final confrontation is resolved, the victorious animals established their position of power, taking the spoils and becoming more and more exploitative, leading to a more and more unequal animal society, to the point where the animals and the humans are not distinguishable any more.

### Write a short statement that describes your interest to this story/movie, or rather: Why does this story matter to you? (100 words)

I find this story to be a fascinating example of how an allegory can be used to convey any message. The story follows that of the Soviet Union and the raise of Stalin, but using a metaphorical setting of an English farm, bringing that "far-away" land closer to the book "main market" at the time. For me, it is a brilliant example of story telling and I was taken back by the creativity involved in turning real history into a "fairy story".

### Comments
What is the strongest or most compelling thing about the studentâ€™s submission? Is there something they wrote that made you want to read more?
  1. The part about the raise of Stalin, and how stories could build themselves around a strong message like this one. I didn't read that novel yet, but I will ! 
  2. I really liked how you synthesized the story. Very effective.
  
what is one thing the student could do to communicate their story ideas more clearly or effectively?
  1. If it's possible, maybe name some of the main protagonists, so that we can see more clearly who's doing what. 
  2. I might have understood wrongly the concept of the SPINE. I thougt it was supposed to be the main theme of the story, for example, ANIMAL FARM is a story about de reorganization of a society and the problems that come within, also is about the difficulties we all have to assume while promoting change within ourselves and those sorrounding us. Either way i really liked the way you did this task, it was brief but really focused on the story.
