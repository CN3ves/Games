## Assignment
In this assignment you are asked to draw three different versions of the same character, 
but with a twist: you must use a real object as inspiration for your designs.

Examples:

  * Design a giant robot tank using elements from an an old metal typewriter
  * Design an aquatic monster based on a unusual vegetable you find at the grocery store
  * Design a costume for a traveling character using shapes and symbols from an old roadmap

Please do not choose another video game or animated character as your inspiration—look 
in your environment for something more unexpected.

Take some photos or sketches of your inspiring object, and then try three takes on 
the same character and see how it goes. Upload both your inspiration and your three designs as two separate images.

You must also include a short paragraph that describes your character and your working 
process (what you found interesting in your selected object, or how the object changed the design).


## Submission

### title
Volcano Guardian

### In a short paragraph, describe your character and your process of developing three iterations of the character using a source of inspiration. 

##Characters##
My character is based on Edinburgh's volcanic hill and landmark called Arthur's Seat. When considering this challenge, this hill remained me of the Aztec tale of Popocatépetl and Izataccíhuatl, in which an Aztec warrior turned into a volcano. From here I decided to explore potential designs for a Volcano-related Warrior, a guardian to a sacred mountain. I found this to be a broad concept they would yield itself to the exploration of various distinct design approaches.

  * My first approach was rooted in the original legend, and I explore the design of a pre-hispanic warrior (on the right). Historical elements include the idea of the jaguar warrior, where this character wears spotted yellow clothing, and also green feathers (evoking both the connection to earth and the precious quetzal feathers). The volcano is represented by the magical elements, particularly the thick, solid rock shield and the fire wielding powers of this sorcerer/warrior character.
  * My second approach (middle) was to anthropomorphize the volcano into a earth-based guardian. Here, the head of the guardian is the fiery volcano itself. The thick rock shield texture from the previous iteration is now part of the character's body, the fire spills out from his head (even though it looks like an hat...) and the hair is formed from the green vegetation that grows on the fertile land around the volcano.
  * My last approach (left) was more literal, as in the volcano is the guardian. In this case I imagined an organic volcano which would twist and move. The twisting of the top of the volcanic cone gives this character have a serpent-type look completely alien and monstrous.

##Design##
All these design represent different concept of a volcano guardian and use different design approaches.

  * The sorcerer has more **round and proportional shapes**. He also has **more props and higher density** which provides his **story and background** connection to the volcano.
  * The earth creature is drawn using **more solid straight and irregular lines**, all of which associate with the rough rocky nature of a volcano or mountain. The **proportion** is not as relevant here (for example the different sized legs), reflecting the chaotic natural nature of this character.
  * The more alien design his very simple, with **low density and few lines**, but with **added organic characteristics** to bring some living dynamic to the inorganic volcano.
  * All **colors** considering are in line with the **natural mood** of a volcanic landscape with green representing the fertile land, brown the rocky mountain and red the fiery magma within the volcano itself.

##Usage##
The usage of each of these three interpretation of the same character concept would most likely fits different game types and concepts, even though I can envision these being three forms of the same character. In this case, the mythology of the world could be animist-based and the spirit of the volcano itself could take on various shapes and forms during its interactions with the player.

##Technique## (cough cough)
My drawing skills are not professional, but I have no experience with drawing software. As such, these designed were first sketched by hand, and "scanned" my phone picture to a PowerPoint where I colored them. This is definitely not the best technical approach, but I do find it resulted in a very characteristic end design.


### Upload an image (photograph or sketch) of your selected object that influenced your designs.

### Comments
What is, in your opinion, the strongest or most exciting thing about their character designs?

  1. The description of the mental process and ideas behind the design, and so the narrative choices that made the drawings so different in style and characteristics. Apart from the style, which is pretty naive, I really liked the approaches that defined each of the characters. You have a good imagination and a fine sense of the narrative, my compliments!
  2. Great work. Very indepth overview and analysis.
  3. excellent
  
What is one thing the student can do to improve their designs? Do you have a suggestion to make the designs more interesting or exciting? 

  1. Just add some quality to the design man!
  2. I understand it is not an active volcano, but I would imagine volcanic creatures more made of magma. Looks cooler. :)
  3. you had a great work
