## Assignment
In this assignment you are asked to draw three different versions of the same character, 
but with a twist: you must use a real object as inspiration for your designs.

Examples:

  * Design a giant robot tank using elements from an an old metal typewriter
  * Design an aquatic monster based on a unusual vegetable you find at the grocery store
  * Design a costume for a traveling character using shapes and symbols from an old roadmap

Please do not choose another video game or animated character as your inspirationâ€”look 
in your environment for something more unexpected.

Take some photos or sketches of your inspiring object, and then try three takes on 
the same character and see how it goes. Upload both your inspiration and your three designs as two separate images.

You must also include a short paragraph that describes your character and your working 
process (what you found interesting in your selected object, or how the object changed the design).
