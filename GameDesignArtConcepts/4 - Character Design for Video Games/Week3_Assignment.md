## Assigment

This assignment asks you to examine and consider the characteristics of existing characters and styles that you've found inspiring and adapt them to different styles. The goal here is to discover what makes characters recognizable and unique, and how changing certain elements can make them fit into a new world.

First, select two characters from a game, show or movie that you like.

Then, re-design them to fit the context of a different game, show or movie.

Examples:

  * Re-design Mario and Luigi from Super Mario Bros so that they fit into the world of Grand Theft Auto
  * Re-design Finn and Jake from Adventure Time so that they fit into the world of Pac Man.

Upload your characters as a single image (PDF, jpg, png or gif).

Additionally, you must include a short paragraph that describes your characters and their original source/context, and the approach you took to adapt them to the new context. Please include a link that shows your original source characters, and a link that shows the world you're adapting their designs to fit. These links will be helpful for the people reviewing your work, just in case they aren't familiar with your source characters or your target world.

## Submission 

### title
Force invaders 

### In a short paragraph, describe your selected characters, their original source/context and the new context you have placed them in. Additionally, describe the approach you took changing certain elements of the character to fit the new context. 
For this exercise I chose characters from the [Star Wars movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars) and adapted them to the game of [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders). I chose these two sources as they are widely famous and recognizable and they share a similar space thematic, but one is originally from the cinematic media while the other is from an early gaming media. As such, these two sources require very distinct character designs, but the overall theme can be maintained, which I found to be an interesting mixture.

The two character I chose were [**Darth Vader**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader) and [**Yoda**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda). In the their original context (Star Wars), these characters represent two opposing sides of the *Force*. Darth Vader represents the dark side of the Force and the new oppressive Empire, while Yoda represents the light side of the Force and the remains/resistance from Old Republic. Their original designs makes them widely (and easily) recognizable, allowing them to easily fit a much simpler and pixel-based concept such as Space Invaders. I have done this by focusing on their main characteristics with a minimalist approach:

 * Darth Vader becomes represented by his [unmistakable helmet](https://www.starwars.com/databank/darth-vader)
 * Yoda is represented by his long [pointy ears](https://www.starwars.com/databank/yoda).
 * The design is out-of-**proportion** (head only) keeping with their new game strictly representative purpose
 * Very low element **density** was used, maintaining only the main characteristics that allow to distinguish the characters, in order to create the old pixel-based design feeling.
 * Simple coloring is additionally used to identify various game elements, with the particular care of maintaining the original coloring concepts and **mood** from the movie (Yoda in green, dark Force lasers in red, etc.)

In the "Force Invaders" context, Darth Vader takes the place of the invading aliens, while Yoda takes the place of the defender, maintaining the original antagonism between these characters, and playing with the same idea of an oppressive empire and its resistance. The design (with me not having any drawing experience) was obtained by drawing squares on PowerPoint and placing them together, ensuring a pixel based image, true to the design of Space Invaders (which surprisingly I could not achieve by hand!).

## Comments
What is, in your opinion, the strongest or most exciting thing about their character designs?
  1. great
  2. it's awesome!
  3. This is wonderful :) I love this!
  
What is one thing the student can do to improve their designs? Do you have a suggestion to make the designs more interesting or exciting? Or can you suggest some ways your peer can adjust the design to make the designs fit their target environment more clearly?
  1. i cant say anything
  2. i have nothing to add! all is great!
  3. You did a wonderful job distilling the characters down. They are still readable even at their small size.
