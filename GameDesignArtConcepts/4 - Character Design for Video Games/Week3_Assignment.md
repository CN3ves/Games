## Assigment

This assignment asks you to examine and consider the characteristics of existing characters and styles that you've found inspiring and adapt them to different styles. The goal here is to discover what makes characters recognizable and unique, and how changing certain elements can make them fit into a new world.

First, select two characters from a game, show or movie that you like.

Then, re-design them to fit the context of a different game, show or movie.

Examples:

  * Re-design Mario and Luigi from Super Mario Bros so that they fit into the world of Grand Theft Auto
  * Re-design Finn and Jake from Adventure Time so that they fit into the world of Pac Man.

Upload your characters as a single image (PDF, jpg, png or gif).

Additionally, you must include a short paragraph that describes your characters and their original source/context, and the approach you took to adapt them to the new context. Please include a link that shows your original source characters, and a link that shows the world you're adapting their designs to fit. These links will be helpful for the people reviewing your work, just in case they aren't familiar with your source characters or your target world.
