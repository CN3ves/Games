## Assignment 

In this assignment I'd like you to try designing a character that you’d consider using in a game, trying three different approaches. The goal here is to start thinking about how and why your drawings work (or don’t work) and to get used to trying different approaches to your designs.

You can draw them with pencil and paper, or digitally paint them, or make a collage, or any method you’d like. The technique is less important than the design itself.

In each variation, try to work with one of the concepts we’ve covered in this week's lesson:

    Density
    Mood and Story
    Proportion

To accompany your drawings, please also include a short description of your character: name, background, motivations and story—whatever information you think would be useful to help support your design choices. Also, please explain the different approaches you're attempting in each drawing - for instance, "In the third drawing, I'm adjusting my proportions to try to make my character less cute." or "In the second drawing, I'm trying to add some elements to my design to help communicate a little more of my character's story."
