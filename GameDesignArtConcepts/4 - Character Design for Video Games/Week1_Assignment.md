## Assignment 

In this assignment I'd like you to try designing a character that you’d consider using in a game, trying three different approaches. The goal here is to start thinking about how and why your drawings work (or don’t work) and to get used to trying different approaches to your designs.

You can draw them with pencil and paper, or digitally paint them, or make a collage, or any method you’d like. The technique is less important than the design itself.

In each variation, try to work with one of the concepts we’ve covered in this week's lesson:

  * Density
  * Mood and Story
  * Proportion

To accompany your drawings, please also include a short description of your character: name, background, motivations and story—whatever information you think would be useful to help support your design choices. Also, please explain the different approaches you're attempting in each drawing - for instance, "In the third drawing, I'm adjusting my proportions to try to make my character less cute." or "In the second drawing, I'm trying to add some elements to my design to help communicate a little more of my character's story."

## Submission

### Title
Vampire hunter concept

### Provide a short written description of your character. 
My character is a conceptual character and does not have a name at the moment. He joined a militant religious order that seeks to track and hunt down the dark creatures that roam freely in the world. It was as a member of this religious order that my character learned his skills and became a specialized vampire hunter. As such, his motivation is the safety of the people by protecting them from these dark creatures. 

### Upload all three character designs as a single image.

### Describe the different approaches you're attempting in each of your three designs
I am not a designer and my drawing skills are not professional. Even so, I decided to draw some character sketches as using software is probably worse :p

For my first design, I considered a game situation where little character detail would be required. For example, we can think of a top-view 2D map, where the character "pin" moves about. Without the need for complex detail, this "pin" can be simple an "out-of-proportion" head moving around the map. This disproportion allows for different expressions to be made clear. For example, random encounters can be indicated by an in-game change of expression (bottom head). In this design, I also explored the effect of the hat "pose". On top, we can see that a more formal and less "cool" effect is obtained with a straight sitting hat (so much so that it called for a monocle!).

For my second design, I explored the effect of character proportion. By having a complete body, I can add some additional props (sword and shield) which communicates clearly that the character is some sort of fighter. Unlike the previous design, this full-bodied, proportional design allows the character to be used in additional game situations, such as combat. Thus different body proportions can indeed be associated with different in-game roles (big head: map navigation; full body: combat/action).

For my last design, I explored the effects of density in conveying the background/story of the character. I've changed the clothing to a more priestly robe, added a cross necklace, a (holy) book and a belt with a wooden stake and some garlic (identifying these props from my drawings may not be an easy task!). By increasing the detail of the character design with the addition of props (increasing the density), it is easier to communicate his membership to a religious order (robe, cross, book), his potential relationship with vampires (wooden stake, garlic) and, being armed (sword), deduce his role as a vampire hunter.

## Comments

What is, in your opinion, the strongest or most exciting thing about their character designs?
 
  1. No comment
  2. Nice idea and written description really helps to understand your character!
  
What is one thing the student can do to improve their designs? Do you have a suggestion to make the designs more interesting or exciting? Or can you suggest some ways your peer can adjust the designs to articulate their character more clearly?

  2. I would like to see more diversity in character designs, while preserving the idea
