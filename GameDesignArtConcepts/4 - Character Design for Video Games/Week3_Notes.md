# Design with Purpose

### Studio Visit with Jacky Ke Jiang

Jacky Ke Jiang, an artist who's worked with Disney, designed characters for the video game Journey, and created really wonderful work through his independent "Timecard" project.
Jacky Ke Jiang is a very busy artist. Check out some of his work and see what he's been up to!

I gave Jacky a challenge: I asked him to create some designs for a "Dance-Dance-Revolution"-style game 
set in the 1960s, in which astronauts would have dance-offs with robot opponents. Jacky's going to 
take us through his process, as he creates some designs for possible characters.
even though we're focusing on paper-and-pencil sketches, Jacky suggested that he take one of his designs,
turn it into a 3D character on his laptop, and make it dance.

### 2D Ink Drawing

Usually I start with just a very simple initial idea.
Sometimes I don't have any idea.
I would just say okay make up an idea when I draw.
So I don't really start with a lot of ideas in my head.
I usually just start doing it.
Kind of like a dance and music.
You just start to feel the mood and the beats and you start drawing.

And then eventually,
once I put down a line I would realize oh no this line is totally horrible.
Now I have to add another line.
To make the first line seem intentional.
Oh, the second line's messed up again.
Let's keep going.
Hey its starting to look like a figure.
So that's kind of how I drew is just always reacting to the previous line.
So it's kind of like a hide and seek chess game with myself.
So eventually I end up filling the whole page.
It's like okay, now it's done, cuz there's no more line can be added.
So I can just start drawing a mission commander.

I guess it's kinda like how you create any kind of music in your garage.
It just started with some simple rhythm, beats, see what fits.
By the time you finish your 10,000th hour of drawing practice.
You probably already have some pre-existing notion of
how things should go.

And so when you start drawing, you just know exactly what you do.
Sometimes you don't really need to think.
But if you start overthinking it, you're putting your ego on the line.
You start over editing things and things start to become dittering.
So I started with a very serious man.
But I started thinking, okay you're setting this back in the 60s.
So things need to be slightly happier, so I add the leg a little.
Laughing, teasing, side.

So, it's definitely over thinking.
If I over think it, I will probably start as a very cartoony design.
we're always on the verge of trial and error.
If they don't look like they're from the 60s, I'll just add some 60s groove to it.

But right now they don't really look like 60s.
When I think of 60s I think of two ways.
You have the pop culture version of the 60s.
And then you have the legit hardcore science of the 60s.
Like the 60s, the beginning of the space age.
So, a lot of very simple machinery and
computer was rising.
So that's the serious science of it.
So, the designs seem to be bulkier and complex, in a way.
Like right now you think about any kind of user interface.
You have a touch screen and
the buttons super simple because you can display all kind of art.
But back in the 60's, people tend to layout every single options on the table.
Because that's how, that's how like anyone would, kind of like how you know those
recording sound studios have all kinds of crazy buttons.
Because they don't know how to consolidate into a smaller amount.
So that's how I felt about this.
In the grander scheme of things, a lot of repeating patterns,
which is very interesting and nice to look at.
You have the bands between the repeating pattern from nature,
from all the Ecstasies and drug experience.
Oh, and that's the other big part about the 60s.
You have the hippie movement.
And then you have the machinery's from the 60s,
which is like the mega version of the 50s.

That's the other thing about any period of time is.
There's a lot of things you notice from different time periods.
They look super odd and weird.
It doesn't feel like it belongs to that period.
Those things tend to stand out to me.
Versus, oh if you think about 1960s there are certain shapes you always think of.
To me that seems like a low-hanging fruit to please the audience, very simply.
It's the fast food way of pleasing the audience.
Like putting the Eiffel tower in the background.
So you know you're in Paris.

So I prefer to give player a visual puzzle,
in the way like you have to think a little bit more.
Cuz the more you think, the more you're worrying it is.
But you wanna give them a low entry point.

It's like, a good game design is always easy to get into and harder to master.
That goes to everything I think.
As you can see, I'm not really going towards any exact styles.
I'm kinda, just go as what I felt like is right in the moment.
So that's how you created your personal unique style I guess.
What I put when I'm drawing I say this is a good design.
If it doesn't work then I will make something up, a new design for
a different story.

I guess,
it's like a very ground-up approach to make things instead of having the idea of.
Okay, this is the character it's supposed to be.
This is the storyline, this is how the character needs to act and
express certain emotion.
I just start drawing and then the drawing will tell me what the character is.
And what the character wants to be and how the character needs to feel.
And now it's just like oh okay you want to go this way I will facilitate.
It's almost like you become the slave to your drawing in a way.
Like also that's to me, drawing is not too much of a professional
practice, to me personally is a very spiritual and meditative kinda idea.
It's just like a perfect opportunity to let my ego go.
To see what my body can do without controlling it too much.


I feel like we as artists, we're dealing with a lot of noise in the world.
Our job is to be a filter.
To filter through all the noises and find a good part to
manifest a universal pattern in some way.
So that's why an artist needs to practice so many drawings,
is just to get familiar with his medium.
So, the more you do it, the less it becomes a thinking process.
The more it becomes a muscle memory process.


To get environment right,
I guess I loosely have a somewhat of a fixed perspective in mind.
It's like I see usually I have the point a view either from you're eye view,
eye level or I like to do more of a diagram.
It's like because I do a lot of 3D.
So I really love the 45 degree tilted view.
Kind of like a building diagram. Is it lithographic
So basically, I feel that instantly
creates agreement between you and the audience.
Because the audience won't feel like oh, this is just crazy randomness.
I can't really find any pattern.
I think a good, successful art piece should allow the audience to enter.
But dazzle them and create some kind of things surprising them.
So, if they're drawing without if the drawing has a lack of structure and
perspective.
Usually it will turn the audience off,
because then your consciousness directly goes into oh this is a bad joint.
So if you get your structure correct it doesn't have to be accurate
to a three point perspective, or any scientific perspective.
You have to establish a rule in the very beginning.
You have to let the audience know what the rule is.
And you want to follow that rule, very gratefully, and truthfully.
And stick to the rule, because that is to me is a respect to the audience.
If you can respect the rule.
But you can bend the rule, and somehow trick the audience.
Oh, I didn't think this way, but
it's still follows the rule that you established in the beginning.
That's where I think a good successful art piece comes from.

What kind of rules do you work with?
I think the rule I want to work with, like I said in the beginning, is **perspective**.
Secondly, I'm working with a black ink.
Pen and a white paper.
So the rule, it's like a building rule.
It's very simple.
And there's a border of the frame.
That is also another rule.
I won't draw out of the paper.
So that's the kind of rule I follow.
It's very basic.

Hw do you know when a drawing is done?
I think it's a discipline again.
It's kinda like a rule discipline.
You can always add detail yes.
But once you **establish the density** between two inclines.
You want to follow strictly that line density.
You don't want to have one anomaly out of everything.
It's all comes boil down to pattern matching in a way.
Like if you did one thing in your drawing, that thing's very special.
You want to do it again somewhere else,
but have a slight different variation of it.
It's kind of abstract in a way.
It's almost in a way very scientific.
Like if you have something on page, you wanna repeat that pattern somewhere else.
But not too much, cuz you wanna have.
Another rule is a rule of three.
You **have the one major focus** and
then you have the secondary focus and then you have a third.
So you follow a rule of that.
I'm trying to figure out the rule myself.
Based on my feeling of, oh yeah, this drawing looks nicer than the other one.
Why? And then he started to try to find the rule.
The rules aren't used to set up your drawing.
They're used to solve problems that you see in the drawing

I learned over the years that a good
artist should learn how to constantly contradict himself.
Like, I establish a rule and then I realize the rule is not the rule.
There is no rule.
So, it's a very weird zen exercise.
So, I'm just as excited to see this drawing as you.
That's the other thing about drawing is once you have the rule all set up and
you know exactly what to do.
You usually kill the magic.
A little bit.
You kind of want to be curious about what you're gonna do.
Just have that child sense of wonder is very important to drawing because
ultimately what we are doing is playing.


How do you change your approach when you feel yourself getting bored with
you're project? I guess I listen to podcast and
music and see if that will add something to the mix.
So it become, when something you realize it becomes boring to you.
It's usually because all the rules are dry, and all the lines are set up.
This also goes back to a quite interesting how video game
level designer would design a level.
Is you would never wanna establish just one straight line in front of you and
then there's a beacon.
Cuz nobody would wanna just walk like a boring straight line
all the way to the end, spanning five minutes.
You wanna make it windy, you want to create interest and
decoration along the side.
So I think that's the, there's a little bit of truth in that.
It's kind of life.
Everybody is raising from birth to death.
But it's what's in between that matters the most.
So sometimes you feel like your life is boring.
Maybe you should just go to a different place.
But we all know the ultimate goal is become dust in
the facilitate other part of life.

So it's all about how you think.
If the work itself become boring to you.
Maybe you can focus on the exercise of focusing on the music
that creates something more interesting.

So you're actually thinking about producing this game in 3D.
Then I will totally draw it a different way.
Because this level of line work and detail is going to be very hard to produce in 3D.
Although you can do like what Borderline, that video game does.
By creating like a ink texture mapping.
But that would require a lot of time.

I think the best simple CG solution would be using flash heating.
Then that means it's totally a different design.
I would just start playing with shapes in Photoshop instead.
I will give him really small legs so it's simpler to draw.

When I'm working the computer I sketch out.
I started with just some simple doodling in Photoshop.
Just big brush strokes and play with simple shapes.
Shape language was always very important.
When I was working at Disney feature.
They were always talking about straight versus curve.
The harmony between different shapes.
And I'm sure you guys talk about that a lot everywhere.
So, looks like I smeared a little bit here, I got some weird thing here.
So what I will do is I'll make that into a part of the art.
So it looks intentional.
I do that all of the time.

So whenever I feel like there's an idea I want to think of,
or maybe I have no idea, just want to mediate and just do a drawing.
To me, it's just kind of makes me happy when people like what my output is.
Why do you work with Ink?
Cuz I noticed you're almost exclusively ink,
because there's not a lot of colored pencils, or mechanical pencils.
I used to do pencils, but then I just got lazy.
I was like, why not just make the statement clean and simple.
In a way, each material art tool you use has its own rhythm and
the quality.
And, I think they're just patterns.
What really matters is the idea and truth and theme of the thing.
So you can say it.
It's like, different tools, like different language.
You can express the same feeling or idea with different language.
So what I like is to choose something simple so people have less learning curve.

### 2D Tablet Drawing
No I can just do it on my phone,
cuz that's the other thing I usually do is I start just sketching using my app.
So basically this is a program I have been using for the last five years.
It's called Sketch Club.
I highly recommend it.
I like this better than the Autodesk one.
Maybe I'm just used to it.
It's just a lot more simpler and It has everything I need and
you can record process.
So, I'm gonna start recording.
Like what Photoshop has, you can do layers, you can fill colors.
So I usually start with a color fill.

Just to not draw in the white background.
Drawing on the white is like you already push it to 11.
They have become more of a carving into a negative black process.
But in digital, we have the freedom to use any colors.
And when I use a brush, I use super simple,
just one brush and draw all of them in different sizes.

And once again, stylus don't really have pressure sensitivity.
So first I was really bummed out, but later I really discovered that's actually
really good, because then you're putting down very confident value.
If you can make a drawing with very simple just flat color,
that's better than dithering with values too much.

There's many tools I can use right now I'm just gonna use some very simple ones.
I'm laying down some very basic values so
I can pick them very easily just by holding down to the canvas.

Also make sure I only draw on the separate layers.
It's almost like just painting.
When I was at Disney featured,
that's when I started using this tool to do a lot of observational oil painting,
instead of, everyone else is doing analog oil painting.
I'm just doing a lot of this type of thing because you can redo and
undo very quickly.
And you don't have to mess with oil.
Cuz' learning how they use real oil to paint is a trick on its own.
I'm just playing with a very simple shape, you wanna start with a bigger brush.
I wanna start with a very simple idea my head.
What do I want this player to do?
So I'm trying to think of scenario, okay.
Maybe he's already in a dance pose, rather than a T-Pose.
When you make a character,
it's much better to have the character doing what it wanted to do.

Then just put him into a straight T-Pose.
T-Pose is like a very standard staying in 3D animation,
you have a character, you put the arm out and you put the leg down like that.
That's a T-Pose.
The reason why you put the character in the symmetry T-Pose is so
you can put a skeleton into the character.
So you can make them animate.
But the downside of T-Pose is obviously it's a T-Pose.
It doesn't really reflect how the character behaved in any way.
So, it kinda take away part of the character.
So, what you're really focusing on is the costume and the body shapes.

But when you start initial concept,
you wanna start something more than just a T-Pose.
You can always bend the character back to a T-Pose when you,
go back into the production.

T-Pose way back when remembered of very classic.
>> [INAUDIBLE] yeah the [INAUDIBLE] in the circle.
>> Yeah I'm surprised no one has made a 3D model of that.
Somebody should do that like a model people do that,
that will be pretty interesting so much.

To do in so little time.
That's my frustration.
If I can do everything that went through my head, yeah, I'll be a lot happier.
>> I noticed your sticking with magenta's and greens.
>> Mm-hm >> Why those two colors?
>> I don't know, I kind of just always felt like i wanted some 60s groove.
Cuz' astronaut always used like a brownish grey, it's very serious.
So I wanna maybe use some prime playful color in this one instead.
But I guess that is the one rule I bended.

The design itself should be more realistic maybe or maybe more legit.
>> Well we're bending some of the rules there weren't artificial intelligent
robots back then either.
>> Yeah exactly.
So I guess that what I'm getting from the idea is I want,
I'm thinking about something very playful.
Make something, Something not serious.
It's about playing.

So once again, there's really no detailing, it's just a pose.
Right now.
So but now you can, once you have established a very strong silhouette.
Then you can start laying down some details.
But it's all about how different you wanted that it to shift.
Because a good concept art.
I cannot really say the good concept art it just the latest trend.
Is to have the color really pushed to one direction, so when you look at it
you can have the detail color shift on different props.
You can also have it to be accentuated based on the real lighting resources.
Does that make any sense?
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, so it all depends on what you wanna say.
If you want your character to appear to be very physical.
Sell the of,
is in the real physical world, then you can even go out and study,
make like a little, realistic armature and put the bounce lighting into it.
Really study the light.
How he behaves.
And then use that as your primary example.
But if you want this thing to be more decorative, like a fly to the drawings,
you wanna accentuate the detail design on the shapes.
Then you focus on just finding interesting shape,
doing some research on the internet or magazine.
And then put them together.
But when you have two at the same time, you kinda wanna still manage how much of
each you want, cuz' you don't want it to take too much of a sensory overload.
You want it to make sure they don't compete with each other.
A good drawing, everything you should to sing the same tone.

But the one's you can start with a design the rest of is all detail management.
I like to put just a hint of gray, in the same color family into each color.
It's a trick a lot of painters uses.
What it does is it creates a very,
it makes the color, the saturated color, much more vibrant.
It makes your, it tickles your eye in a very good way.
So that's what I like.

Also the other thing I do is I can turn lower the transparency
that will create a nice color mix.
But I don't do that too often because if you do that too often your color,
your drawings start to become blurry.

The first couple patch of color is very important.

Because that pretty much establish what color you want to be in this drawing.
So you have wanted to have a better transition between this and this.
I just go to the, the gray scale, put brush to be 50% transparent.
And just brush it once over.
And then you'll create a nice transition.
You can just.
I don't know if you can see it.
[INAUDIBLE] I can zoom in here.
The art director from Journey, Matt Nava, he got me into this.
Jaw on the phone theme with me but
I don't know if he actually does this on the phone.
He just does it as hobby.
But a lot of early design for
the dagon county next game is actually done by phone.
Just because I was, I just happened to be in the place I don't have my computer.
And in a coffee shop I just start doodling.
Is a very handy tool and
as far as phone now is a huge, like iPhone 6 Plus is like Galaxy.
It's a big dimensions so you can really get a nice drawing going.
>> Yeah. >> The what
it does is allows you to draw small but they can appear as they big.
Cuz' all you need to do is zoom in, [LAUGH] it's big.
So it doesn't matter what the format is.
Anyway, like right now for example,
I'm drawing this one astronaut doing the dance move.
Clearly, composition wise, I can't really fit the other robot onto it anymore, but
because it's digital, what I do is.
I can raise this layer and duplicate it.
And then always make a safe duplicate layer.

And then I can just do like a scaling after I did some work.

So this way I can draw a robot and fit it to the side.

I can either make it taller or shorter.
Like tweak the composition a little bit.
Here and there.

I like that so now I have more space to work with the robot.

Again I don't really draw the whole structure yet.
I just play with the shapes.
If I don't like the shape I just change it.

And when I'm going with this shape, I'm not really thinking in terms of robot, I'm
just thinking about abstractly [INAUDIBLE] what shape looks pleasing and interesting.
And to make a robot out of that shape.
So it's important for us to break the category first,
create something that's outside the category, and then re-categorize it later.

That's how we create new and beyond what's there.

So right now what's happening is, I felt like the color pattern design is a little
too overwhelming, so I'm using some like lower opacity brush to dim down the color.

Just overlay it so it doesn't draw too much of your eye.

But as soon as I've finished that, I will go back to the sharper design.

This will cover it up.

>> One of the things I think is tough about drawing with pen is not
really knowing what the whole character's gonna look like until it's done.
>> Mm-hm.
Because you have to start partially.
>> Yeah, how do you deal with that?
>> Let's see.
I'm gonna deal with drawing things you can only draw half.
Well, the same way I deal is I can't read your mind.

Just, knowing what limitation is, and work with what you have.
So because the pen has this

policy of you can draw it but you can only draw it halfway from a side.
That allows so much more wonder and
surprise elements when you finish the drawing.
And that's something you can never do when you, I can't say never,
never say never right?
That's something, other medium might not have the same thing.
Cuz' when you brush, your one brush stroke,
that may just look like a human silhouette.
And you're done. >> Mm-hm.
>> It's a very quick feedback rule.
So the drawing has that nice feeling of you draw super slow.
And then you put detail here and there.
And then you see the whole picture.
It creates this cinematic movie experience when you're creating art don't you think?
It's like you start with a blank slate.
You have nothing on the page.
And then you end with now I understand what this is all about.
>> Okay yeah I think so.
>> It's like cathartic.
>> Oh is it a problem that you can't see the whole thing, all at once.
You're saying it's good to have that surprise.
>> Mm-hm, yeah, it's good to have that surprise.
So once again, this is a very quick just a rough concept of what this robot is like.
Now I could start drawing another character if I wanted to.

Like a secondary character.

Maybe I'll change a different color.

>> Trying a totally different color there?
>> Mm-hm.
Again, I'm working with a very simple shape.

So that character is small and in the back so
he needs a little bit more close ranged value.

And it's a very very subtle difference.

Again, I'm still just an entry point student in terms of finding good values.
Those Disney guys they're super amazing at doing it.
Just really push value to be so
close range but just enough you can tell the difference.

To me that is Kung Fu.
You know Kung Fu actually means mastery on something in Chinese.
It means effort, but in the western culture it just means martial art.

You have people say in China.

When you something is amazing, you say, oh that requires a lot of Kung Fu.

It means it requires a lot of effort.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So they appreciate it.

Maybe that's why when you grow older you start to appreciate finer things more,
it's because you know your life is fleeting away.
And you understand what each minute and second mean for each person.
So when you see something takes a lot of time to do,
you really appreciate it versus when kids see it, they take it for granted.
Cuz they don't know the relative terms of how much is a second.

Or minute.

Also the other thing I really like, I like podcasts.
>> Yeah.
>> I think I just like humorous and
in general, I think laughter is the ultimate weapon against death.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Cuz' no matter, what you do in life
if you become too depressed if you can laugh about it that means you win.

You win the round.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So I like I like comedies.
So there you go.
I just did some very simple 60s groove.
Maybe I'll add a planet on the back.
I'm sure I can just put this layer on the back

Laying down some more aggressive colors.

But I felt like I made a mistake.
I should be drawing the space first cuz then

I can use the color to block the color in front.
You will see what I mean as soon as I start putting blocking color.

See part of it I was using

the third color to shape the character, now the dirt shows why.
This is a discipline thing.
If I was being more disciplined.
It won't happen.
I would just make sure I use erasers rather
than use a different color to paint.

Now I'm just putting down some big colors.
Kinda like to add a little bit of, add a mist here
even though on Mars they don't have an atmosphere.

>> Is there a subject matter or
something that you really wanna see in a game that you haven't seen yet?
>> Subject matter >> Just last shooting game,
last robot game, cuz' there's too so many of them.
I wanna see a game explore.

Maybe just different human conditions, make us all connected in some way.

Family value.

Really, really thought about it.
Like make generations understand each other.
That's the kind of game I wanted to see.
Like something we all have in common and
understanding where we are in the grander scheme of things, in the universe.
Understanding there is no bad guy in the world,
we're just all having our world of play.

I guess that's the kinda game I wanna see.
>> Mm-hm.
>> A game operating on a much higher or lower level, is always good.
Like, to me this is just a very simple sketch version of a concept
I can go more detailed into later, but this is perfect for phone size.
But why do my timecard animations,
I usually make a character based on one of those simple concepts.

And save to image.
And done.
>> Cool.
>> All on my phone.
>> Nice.
