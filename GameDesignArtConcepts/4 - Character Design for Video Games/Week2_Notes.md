For Andy's design challenge, I asked him to draw character designs for a hero and some adversaries 
for a video game inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's 
["At the Mountains of Madness"](https://archive.org/details/AtTheMountainsOfMadness/page/n0), 
a story about an arctic 
explorer who finds himself fighting a series of otherworldly creatures. 

### Drawing the Explorer

I'll start with the explorer. I'm gonna just go with what my brain thinks.
When I think of an Arctic explorer I think of **the gear** you have to wear
to be an Arctic explorer.
So I want someone with like a huge jacket I guess that's the first thing I think of
is a giant jacket, with little hands and a little face,
and that guy's got to have facial hair.If it's a guy, it doesn't have to be a guy.
It can be a woman with a beard.

I always draw with red pencil or blue pencil first.
Some sort of colored pencil so I can kinda sketch the idea and
kind of **narrow down the idea first** before I go into things.
Sketch everything out first lightly.
And then I can go over it with a three b pencils, lead pencils and graphite pencils
because they have such a nice dark line, and it's nice and soft.

Usually I **start from my imagination**, but there's definitely times when I'm like,
oh I don't know quite how to draw that.
I'll **look stuff up**, or if I know I'm gonna have to design
a bug or something, I'll look at a bunch of bugs first.
Like a few days before and
just kinda really getting my mind, thinking about stuff.
And then when I draw though I don't like to look at **reference** while I draw.
Because I feel like it limits what I draw.
I end up sticking too closely to the reference.
So if I don't look at anything it kind of
whatever my mind process from the stuff I was
looking at turns into what I draw on paper.
And so, yeah, so you're kind of like
filtering your ideas through your brain and
your hand and your memory, and it just.
I don't have the greatest memory so
it changes a lot once it's filtered through my head.

I like to **draw a lot of ideas and try to vary shapes and
form** and before I come up with a final.
That way you can look at stuff and be like oh this idea was cooler,
or I would say usually your first idea is not the best idea.

Or if you have a whole bunch of different ideas,
you could pick the top three and maybe two others could turn into
different characters that you use, or you can swap pieces and
mix and match it until you now are done exactly what you want.
I think it's great to 
to really mess around and at first try to
go in a bunch of different directions.
So you can see what you like and
what fits in with the world you're building.

I collect books and graphic novels and art books and stuff like that, and I
am constantly going through my collection and weeding out of things that I don't,
like I've either grown beyond it or I don't have any use for it anymore.
So I'm constantly bringing in new books and getting rid of old books.
I think the art is interesting, and
I tend to like stuff that like follows my interests.

I tend to also collect a lot of things that don't look anything like how I draw,
just because it's nice to see.
It's just nice to see **different viewpoints** and just always have my mind kind of
jogging around and looking at different things from different ways.
And yeah, you don't wanna get so focused on how you do things.
You wanna be, kinda at least aware of what else is going on around you.

I'll draw one drawing and then the next drawing, I'll try to find a different
shape or organization that's either the first drawing isn't quite what I want so
I'll switch it up a bit or the second drawing is a complete and
opposite reaction to it, so this guy has a round head.
So, I wasn't even thinking about it, I just kinda went for
a different shape for the second head.
You wanna cover as many faces as possible as you're drawing.
So, you just keep riffing off of yourself and
trying to find different the ways to look at something.
So, like the first one I drew a guy with a beard.
So maybe the next one I'll start drawing a female explorer.
And then the next one will be somebody with a,
maybe this guy's got a Tuke on and goggles, more of a skier.
Or I don't know extreme explorer.

Which I know is not in the story,
but maybe it takes place in modern times this version.
Or maybe with this one I was thinking well what if it's like the future, and
for some reason parkas are now cubical.
I don't know, I just kinda try to come up with different funny ideas.
Or like this guy has a scarf on but
maybe like what if his head is just wrapped in a scarf?

I try to make myself laugh and add humor in.
Like this guy has look, I wanted him to be mostly suit.
So like his hands are gonna be tiny.
And his head is gonna be tiny in this giant padded suit or something.
Yeah, I just, if you've drawn a guy with a big head and
tiny hands, maybe the next guy will be the opposite.
So, a really tiny head.
Show there's giant hands.
And he totally, once you start drawing a guy,
like that guy's more of a lumberjack guy, tough.

I'll draw him again and again.
And every time I draw this character
I slowly get to know, kinda.
Even though this guy is just standing here I feel like I already kinda know
what he's like.

I'm not telling myself a story.
It's kind of like the character **starts to tell the story**.
I really don't try to, when I'm making up characters,
especially during this pass, I'm not really thinking, I'm kind of on autopilot.
And I'm just kind of letting the shapes kind of grow.
And I wish I was doing better drawings, but
as I draw, I'll add this guy's got a monocle.
I don't know.
Just things to make them interesting.
Not that monocles are interesting, but.
The longer you draw a character the more your
mind wanders and you might think of funny things
like why does he have this frog on his shoulder?
Why?
Is it frozen?
How long has it been there?
I don't know, you just start thinking of weird things and then, if this is a game,
and he has a frog on his shoulder, maybe that's part of his weaponry or something.
You start thinking of ways to incorporate the things on his person
that could be turned into something more other than just a weird affectation for
no reason.

I try, generally, especially during this period.
Definitely, I'll draw things I don't like.
Like I don't really like this drawing at all.
But it doesn't matter.
**This is a sketchbook.
Nothing should be perfect**.
This is the first stage.
I just draw as much as I can for an hour or two or until I get sick of it.
Sometimes, when I get sick of it, I stop drawing and work on something else.
Go do something else, then come back to it, draw a little bit more.
And when it feels like I have enough variety and enough ideas that
are interesting, that's when I start looking at things critically.
I don't know this character yet, so
part of the process is making the mistakes and finding the things that you like.

### Refining the Explorer

So I mean we can go to the next step.
I can scan this stuff in and I could combine
the aspects of them in the computer.

Like usually, if I use my sketchbook if I'm not sitting at the computer.
Or if I go, like I'll go get lunch, and sit in a restaurant or
a coffee shop and draw there, I'll bring my sketchbook.
But yeah, a lot of times I start off right in the computer.
It doesn't have, like I think my drawings come out better if they're on paper.
Because the computer still doesn't have that texture and a resistance that paper
gives but you know syntek is good enough.

Okay. So, I have the scanned images here.
I'm just going to **combine them all** into one file,
which there's only two scanned images.
Usually, I would have a lot more than this, but if I had stuff I would.
Probably redraw it until I had like a full body that I liked, but I'm gonna do,
this is the quick way.
I'm gonna **take some pieces from one and add it onto another**.
So, this guy's got, I've taken this.
Guy with the skulls.
Cuz I like kind of, you kind of wonder
what this guy has gone through before this.
I put on this body and
I get rid of these legs and add these legs.

I think
this is just to get who this guy is so I'm not sure how much posing actually matters,
but if I was creating a final
design, I'll put the frog on this guy's shoulder too, cuz I like it.
If I was doing the final design, I might pose it out more interesting.
Sometimes I like of course people aren't, just cuz that kind of creates a mood also.
I'm going to lighten this so it all kind of matches.
Then, I'm going to go through and add more final layer.

I like having a kinda jittery line.
But you can draw it kinda however you want.

One thing I think is interesting in character design is it seems like
**cleanup and props are two separate skills**.
I've seen people who are really good at one and so-so good at rough end.
Do clean ups tend to keep the personality of their roughs?
Cuz I've seen a lot of people do
clean ups where they lose that fun of the roughs.
I mean it's like everything else, it's a skill that you learn.
It just takes practice with
the sentique and the type of pen you're using.

Learning what doesn't work from **practice and trial and error**.
I usually like going in and erasing stuff because sometimes the line I'm
using is too thick and you can't get these nice points.
I usually go in and erase stuff out and that creates a nice little variation.

I mean I've been drawing on this thing for awhile and
I feel like it's still not there, you know?
What I do in the computer is different.
And the choices I would make on paper.

I look at the stuff I did early on
on Adventure Time when I first started doing design for television shows and
the line is definitely a lot different than what I do now.
Yeah, I think there definitely is a learning curve to finding
what works for you.

So, this is kind of **tangent**, but I'm working on this frog right now.
This guy's kind of tough 
So, a tangent would be, okay, so
you've got this room, you've got a guy standing here,
and He had the bottom of his,
So, there are two really horrible tangents.
And, basically, a tangent is when one aspect of a drawing lines up with
something else and what it does is it really flattens out the space or
creates confusion.
And in this case it's creating confusion between the background And
the foreground elements.
And you can use it.
I mean tangents aren't always bad.
You can use a tangent to make someone feel really uncomfortable or claustrophobic or
confused but you don't have to.
It's usually like It's better to overlap
things a little bit, to create, kinda,
oh this guy's standing in front of a.
He's not part of the wall.
He's standing in the room.
Give him a little shadow.
He's waving.

When you're cleaning up your drawings or
whatever you can use kind of a lot of different methods.

I like the line to be a little and organic.
For a game like maybe you're making it with a program
that you're gonna make a little puppet out of the character and
do the animation that way with tweening and stuff.
So, you can add a lot of detail in and not have to worry about animating it later.

But if you're not doing that then you might
wanna make the shapes simpler, and easier to animate later down the road.
But I like to do stuff like, for instance, you can make up little rules
like, for this furry stuff, I'm making one side simple and
the other side has all the you know, like, more detail.

it just makes the drawing more interesting, for me at least.
Oh, this is kind of cool, too.
But, I like that a lot better than that, because everything's all even here.
This I feel has more movement to it and more personality.
It's more in line with the personality of the game I'm trying to make.

Yeah, so you want to see him running around fighting
weird demons from the Beneath the ice and
who knows why he has a frog or skulls.

Design a character you want to make sure all their features are **very readable from
different sizes**, so I just took this guy and shrunk him down kind of half size.
And even smaller and I feel like even at the smaller size,
he's still very readable.

I would probably at the smaller size, go in and design
A simpler Rise in with less detail.
I'm just gonna do this really quickly.
You just want to get the basic shapes.
Basically, 
that reads at that size as a guy with a frog and some skulls around his neck.

### Drawing the Alien

So yeah, I'd start designing some weird creatures.
My favorite thing to do when designing creatures is to just not think,
as I was saying before, and just kinda see what comes up, and
just keep playing around with it until I find some things I like.

So, I guess I'm starting out with a, kinda, humanoid creature,
which I guess isn't that contrasty to this
dude, but let's see where it goes.

I guess what I'm thinking about for these creatures is
have them be** made of shapes but maybe like they're made of ice**.
Just kinda play around like this one is more humanoid,
and then this guys getting more I don't know.
He's still humanoid but
kinda walks like an animal, and now I'm gonna try and just go full on.
I don't know what this thing is.
Let me give it some weird jellyfish tentacles.
While I'm working on I try to stick with a similar shape language,
which if you draw enough you just start to develop ways of drawing certain things.

This would be my crystalline **shape language** I guess.
So I just kinda, I guess when I say it,
I'm talking about things that would connect the characters.
So it would be something that.
Would say no this is the same world.
So kind of, I'm using these things.
That kind of like frozen crystals go whenever, and
so maybe all the bad guys in this game,
they're all unified because they're all made out of the same.
You know, it looks like they're made out of the same stuff.
You know? So Immediately when you see
these shapes jutting out of something.
You know you might you know you see you
immediately start making a connection
between the different creatures I guess,
and eventually you start seeing patterns.

I just love coral and organic shapes and plants,
and that's something I haven't even.
I think it's just a shape language and
that I set the focus on gravitate to.
I can't even say I spend that much time even looking at coral or
undersea creatures, but I just like how weird those creatures are,
and how they're just kinda, you know, they're like especially
like deep sea creatures they're just kind of floating around in a black void.
And it's kind of neat to think about like
the way they developed as a totally based on totally different things than how
humans have developed their mammals so, and one good thing about creatures is you
can make them weird and if they still look like something
interesting, you don't really have to edit them that much.

I think the **angles** really make them look that threatening.
These guys are all kinda jagged pointy and they don't really have faces
which I like.
I feel like all the things I've drawn, they were all like minions.
I haven't drawn one that is like the main bad guy yet.
I just wanna talk about just a little bit.
I've drawn all of these guys.

None of them, they all seem cool and weird,
but I wanna create Something that's like,
the main like, **bad guy** should either be enormous by contrast.
You know, here's the sailor guy freaking out.
So it should either be really huge Or I was thinking it could be like.
And this is kinda.
Neither of these ideas would affect the game play differently.
Or it could be smaller than the guy.
And like appear kind of smart, and maybe while they're battling all the other,
like there's creatures that come in, and form shields around him or
whatever, like he's directing all the other creatures.

I don't, with Lovecraft, though,
it probably would be more like this inhuman thing, it's giant.
Seems more in tune with his stuff.
It's like that horrible features coming out of it,
it's like a combination of a bunch of these creatures kind of fuse together.

### Refining the Alien

Because of the type of creatures these are,
I don't think I would even combine them.
I like the variations, and
I feel like the use of the crystalline
icicle kinda shape language.
Kind of puts them all in the same universe,
so you can tell that these are all variations of themes.
Maybe I'll make a few of them weirder than they are.
But I don't think that I would cut and paste these guys.
I think I like them the way they are.
Just maybe get some of the out of the way.
Give them all a little more room to be themselves.

Yeah, so maybe what I will do is just try to refine them a little more,
in the computer.

I feel like a **lot of that stuff depends on the type of game**.
So I feel like some of these could just be floating and
not really like maybe different parts of them will light up or something.
I have one or two areas that move around, but they don't really need to.
I see them flying around in the air but moving more like jellyfish,
or, like a nautilus squid, or something like that.

So, I'm trying to go through a few of these and
kind of add more ice elements to them, so it's not just like Frozen cubes.
Like maybe there's like icicles, kind of stalactites, stalagmite icicle things.

But in a second I'll clean up one of these things.

I just want to add things that connect them together better.
I can see these characters being
pretty solid and they don't change that much when they're moving but
they probably would have One thing that moves,
so this guy would have his legs would be the big thing.
And this guy the tentacles.
So they'd each have one little thing.

It's definitely interesting, I like drawing really complicated creatures.
So sometimes it's tough to limit things for animation, you know?
So it's nice to get to draw something that's totally crazy looking.
And I can see this guy as being like in the game you fight him and maybe
he takes up several screens and you have to like, you maybe, you run around on him.
Like I can see a thing like, just like so huge.
That Yeah,
it's like you don't see the whole thing at once.
You just see pieces of it.
But this drawing is so loose that I have to go 
Figure out everything before I go to clean up.
Cuz if I just went to clean up right from here it might not look very good.

Yeah and I wanna have like, this thing can be about,
it's more like a land mass than a person.
So, I want to have different areas that are made up of different shapes and.

Different threats.

Something we definitely try to do on Adventure Time is
design creatures that are totally bonkers, you know, and
each one's more bonkers than the last.
Like I really liked It was designed before I worked on the show.
But like it's kind of a sword and sorcery show and they had dragons.
They have dragons on the show but the dragons don't look like dragons at all.
When you think of dragons they're like.
I don't know if I can remember how they look, but
they have these weird like air sacs.
And these big mouths, and they have the gills, or something, I don't know.
They're totally weirdo like little arms,
like T-Rex arms.
They look like weird air fish.
They're not, I don't even think they have wings, maybe they do.
If they have wings, they're tiny wings.
But they have these cool The coolest thing about them
were these weird air sacs that are like, I think Thomas Herpich designed them.
But he threw in these things that you could kinda like,
just by looking at it you're like, I don't quite know how those work but
my brain can make up a way that would make sense.
I grew up collecting comics and watching animation and the thing that always got
me, the first thing that hooked me was always the artwork and the design and
the characters.
That was always the first thing that I looked at
and you know the saying like don't judge a book by its cover.
I wouldn't do that, but
I'd judge it by the design and,
it would always be like, how I'd have to like the art to read a comic.

I've always been kind of fascinated by characters, and I've always kinda.
Like that was half the fun of, I used to play role-playing games,
and I probably spent more time trading characters than
I did playing role-playing games, cuz that was always the funnest part.
Was creating this other personality and
finding out like figuring out the nuances of their character and
their weird quirks and stuff like that.
When I started doing books it was not design, it was for
comics so, that was kinda what I always wanted to do.
I did a lot, I made up a lot of super heroes, whose names were based on bums.
So they're pretty horrible, but
they're all like jokes, they're all jokes, bad jokes.
And I've created hundreds of them, and I would just draw the character, and
then I wouldn't do it.
I would just move on to the next character.

And some characters I would create stories from them, but a lot of time it was just
creating the character and the joke.
This is something, this has hundreds of horrible characters.
Night Blade, the Near Sighted Ninja, he's falling down the stairs.

But it was just them sitting on top of each other, and that was kinda a joke.
So Robodog, Robodog is based on a collage I made.
I've got a lot of these, here's one, the sack, he's just in a burlap sack.


You just wanna **create contrast**, so maybe the busy areas
Are not as big a feature, or
maybe it has like I don't know about that.
But maybe it has a big fin or
like I'm gonna make some areas smaller, I think.
And that's how I'm gonna solve it.
And then when I do the final version.
I just feel like everything's too much the same, like it needs areas of, because
it's so big it needs areas of rest and areas with a lot detail.
Yeah, so I'm just gonna mess around with it till I figure it out.
I already feel like it's feeling more, kind of balanced.
So this I'm gonna use a lot of sharper lines and straight lines.
And like clean up because I want it to be different.
And the dude, all right, I'm just gonna clean up so you can ask questions.

You get used to kind of
redrawing the same line over in design during cleanup,
you just get used to doing this a lot.
Until you get the right line that you want.

Since it's floating, I'm going to make a little shadow
That is what we call good enough.

### Homework
I'd like you to try designing two characters for
your game.But here is the challenge, I'd like these two characters to each be clearly
different in their design, like the Explorer and aliens from Andy.

How can you make them different?

Remember what Andy said about visual language, how the Explorer had softer,
rounder shapes, and the aliens had harsher, sharper shapes?
These qualities set the two designs apart and would make it easier for
a player to understand them in a game.
  * So you could try out a sharper design on one character and
a rounder design on another character.
  * You could try a more mechanical look for one character and a more organic look for
another character.
  * You could try a rustic approach for one and a more modern approach for
one of your other characters.

The reason is that as a designer, it's important to always try
different designs and different approaches while you're working.
So, trying to make two characters different
is a good way to make yourselves try new things.
You might also want to try Andy's approach of drawing many sketches for
your character and then combining the pieces you like into one design by
cutting or tracing your drawings
