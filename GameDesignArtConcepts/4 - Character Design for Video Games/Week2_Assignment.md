## Assignment 

In this assignment I'd like you to expand on the previous assignment and try drawing two characters for a possible game. Maybe one is a hero and another is a villain. One could be a boss and another could be an underling. The challenge will be to give each character a clearly different design.

As an example, think of Andy's approach with his softer, rounder explorer and his harsher, sharper aliens. Or pair a mechanical style on one character with a more organic look for another character. Or a rustic approach on one character could contrast with a more modern approach on another character.

You can draw your characters in a complete pass, or you may want to try Andy's approach of drawing many sketches for your character, and then combining the pieces you like into one design, by cutting or tracing your drawings.

In addition to your two characters, upload a short paragraph that describes your characters, their context (ie. the game) and your approach in designing them.

## Submission

### Title
Dark enemies

### Provide a short written description of your two characters, their context (ie. the game) and your approach in designing them.
I am not a designer and my drawing skills are not professional. As such, I  drew some character sketches and got some light effect from powerpoint (!)

My character design for Week 1 was that of a vampire hunter. This week I made some sketches for potential enemies based on different design choices. The main design oppositions I considered are the line types, line strength and the strangeness (other-wordiness) of the creatures.

  1. The one of the left could be used  a "boss-like" vampire (based on the manananggal myth). This creature is designed to be **fully corporeal, having stronger, more solid lines** defining it. It has clear human shape and anatomy, and even though it's in an undead state, it remains an **organic creature**. The design and density of this sketch is chosen to (try to) make this creature **immediately threatening** (fangs, claws).
  2. The creature on the right is, by opposition, defined by **wavy and less pronounced lines**. As such, this creature does not seem to be organic, but more of a **"plasma" based entity**. It has also less density (simpler) giving it a **stranger** aspect, even though it has still a human shape. It's other-wordiness is further demonstrated by the missing parts on the design (a erased shoulder, arm, etc) and its **brighter** appearance. Its appearance is **more mysterious** than threatening. This creature is more than an enemy to "beat-up", its strangeness raises questions and moves story-line towards (plot-device creature).

In summary:

  * The body of one creature is of (dead) organic matter while the other is plasma-based
  * This is reflected in the contrast of stranger, solid lines with the wavy, less pronounced and brighter lines.
  * Both have human shape, but one is a thread of this world while the other is a mysterious entity phasing between worlds





### Upload both characters side by side in a single image.
