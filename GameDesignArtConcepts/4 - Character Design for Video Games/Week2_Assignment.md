## Assignment 

In this assignment I'd like you to expand on the previous assignment and try drawing two characters for a possible game. Maybe one is a hero and another is a villain. One could be a boss and another could be an underling. The challenge will be to give each character a clearly different design.

As an example, think of Andy's approach with his softer, rounder explorer and his harsher, sharper aliens. Or pair a mechanical style on one character with a more organic look for another character. Or a rustic approach on one character could contrast with a more modern approach on another character.

You can draw your characters in a complete pass, or you may want to try Andy's approach of drawing many sketches for your character, and then combining the pieces you like into one design, by cutting or tracing your drawings.

In addition to your two characters, upload a short paragraph that describes your characters, their context (ie. the game) and your approach in designing them.
