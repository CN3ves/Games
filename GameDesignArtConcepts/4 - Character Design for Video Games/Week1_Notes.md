# Character Design Fundamentals

A good character design communicates things to your players.
It might tell us that we're about to take a plucky plumber through an adventure with
friendly 8-bit graphics or that we're about to play a game that's more
dark and gritty, in a post-apocalyptic world with a character that
likes making outfits out of scavenged materials.

In those two examples we're dealing with two very different characters:
  * one of our characters is simple, the other has a lot of detail.
  * One is cartoony, the other's more realistic, one has a light mood,
the other has a lot darker mood.
  * One has a moustache, the other, maybe, we don't know, there's a mask,
its mysterious.

There's a few concepts that pop up when we compare these two designs,
and I'd like to talk about them in a little more detail.

### Density 
Density, each of these two designs is very different in their density.
And when I say density, I'm referring to the amount of visible elements on each character.

Mario has a hat, overalls, a mustache, shoes and a shirt. That's pretty much it.
Our other character has a telephone, headphones, a road sign, two shirts,
pink hair, a baseball bat, barbed wire, a big old knife,
motorcycle handlebars, a backpack, a gas tank,
a fish hook, stockings, a shoulder pad and various other elements.

What's the effect of density on a design?
Well, the more dense a design,
the more you have to work with to tell your audience about your character.
The denser design can be much more specific.
For instance, we have no idea if Mario's overalls are old or new.
We can't tell how old he is. We don't know the texture of his skin.

With a denser design we're aware of much more specifics about character.
However, the more elements you add to a design the less important each
elements become.
For instance, if we remove Mario's hat, it would change his design quite a bit.
The change would be a noticeable to a player
Now if we remove the other characters bow the design would be less changes.
The player might not even notice.

Now a player doesn't need to notice an element in order for
that element to be justified in your designs.
Sometimes a bunch of small elements can help contribute to an overall feeling like
in a collage.
The number of elements in the Wasteland 2 character contribute to a feeling that
this is a character that's a scavenger.
Just keep in mind that the player will probably be noticing the effects
of all of the elements rather than any one specific element.
If you want an element to be important in a dense design,
it'll need to visually stand out from the other elements in some way.
Whether that be in color, size, texture, style, or design.
With a design that's this dense
you have to try pretty hard to get any one element to stand out.
If we add the bright red hat the player might think of this character as
the character with the bright red hat.
If we want this character to be recognizable or
a standout in a group of similar characters,
it's often helpful to have an element that a player can use to identify them.

### Mood
What's the mood of both of these characters?
Well, just looking at the design decisions that were made by the character designers,
Mario seems cartoony and friendly.
The Wasteland 2 character seems more serious and threatening.
Now, what I like about this comparison is that both designers are using all
the tools in their toolkit to tell you things with their designs.
Admittedly, the Mario designer has a more limited toolkit.
But any designer is working within some sort of limitations, whether that be time,
budget, or technology.

When we look at these designs, what elements in the Mario design tells that
this is a character from a cartoony, friendly game?
Mario has a big, old cartoony head, and
the other character has more realistic proportions.
Mario also has a brighter, happier color scheme.
The Wasteland 2 character is using much more somber, muddy colors.
Mario has a hat but not any large, scary weapons, barbed wire, or a gas mask.

The designers are using **color, pose, props, and
proportions** to communicate a mood to their audience.
 
### Story.
All the elements of a character design can help tell a player what they need to know
about their character's past.
  * Who is the character?
  * What's their story?

Now, this is where some of that visual density we talked about earlier can
really come in handy.
  * Is the character wearing a t-shirt of their favorite band?
  * Do they have a big scar from their last encounter with our game's villain?
The level of story a design needs to communicate varies greatly depending on
the game itself.

In Mario Brothers, as far as I know, Mario has no back story.
The game itself is largely an arcade type game.
The narrative doesn't have any branching plots or back stories.
We're playing one simple storyline from beginning to end.
Mario's past isn't something that needed to be communicated with his design,
then it wasn't.

In the case of this character from Wasteland 2,
we know a lot more about this character's past from their design.
They appear to be an unhappy fighter who's made themselves some handmade armor.
They've been in some battles and have the scrapes to prove it.
They appear to be primarily a fighter, as they have weapons in each hand.
Even though they're on foot, they have a gas can and some motorcycle handlebars, so
they probably are involved in fixing motorcycles somehow.
From that, a player can know that this character is probably from a game where
story is going to be more important than it is in Mario Brothers.
They can find out things about their character from their design and
this can help them to understand their characters place in the game scenario.

So keep in mind, as designers,
we're using character designs to communicate things to our players.
We add elements and design the features of our characters.
A character design might tell the player that they're about to play a fun and
lighthearted game, or a design might tell a player that
they're about to play a dark, post-apocalyptic adventure.

A design can contribute to the mood of a game.
It can help tell something about the character.
As you analyze and work with your designs, ask yourself.
  * What are the different aspects of your design?
  * And what are they communicating to your players?

### Proportion
You've probably noticed that character proportions vary a lot in video games.
There are characters that have mostly regular sized heads,
there are characters that have big heads and
there are characters that are a head with no body at all.

There's a bunch of different factors at play here,
let's just talk about two for now: **a character's size and their purpose**.

Every game has a limited area in which it can display a character.
If the character gets too big, we wouldn't be able to move them around easily or
show enough of the background.
If they get too small,
the player might not be able to see what's going on in the game.

Also, keep in mind that a character is usually moving around the screen
quite quickly.
Even though screens have become larger and more high resolution, it can be hard for
a player to see a specific detail of a character while they're moving around.
The designer might choose to give a character a bigger face so that they can
be more expressive, but then the body might need to be a little smaller.

A character might have more normal proportions if their body is meant to have
realistic acrobatic animation, but
then their face might be too small to show expressions.
Character designs in video games need to balance a character's purpose
with their proportions.

Let's look at Angry Birds.
Well, in gameplay, the birds are just projectiles.
We don't need to see them manipulate objects, or perform complicated poses.
However, it is important to see their facial expressions and their personality.
It's all the more difficult to show their faces since
most people are playing the game on a little cell phone screen.
So it makes a lot of sense to do away with their bodies entirely.
A game like Trine, however, is more about jumping, fighting and acrobatics.
Though it would be nice to see a character's facial expressions,
it's more important, for the purposes of this game, that we see them jump,
fight and perform those acrobatic movements.
So, in this game, we have more natural proportions.
This is why in many games that have natural proportions use cinematic
cut-scenes when they need to tell narrative parts of the story.
It allows the game designers to show more of the character's faces and expressions.

Now there's another reason for adjusting a character's proportions that you're
probably already aware of, and it's not something limited to video game design.
The bigger a character's head, the cuter they look.
If a character has a big head, their proportions start approaching that of
a baby and they start looking a little cutesy.
A character with more natural proportions looks less cutesy.

Choosing your characters general proportions will directly affect gameplay
and your players experience of your game.
It can draw your player's attention to the face or the body movements of a character
and it can effect the cuteness or seriousness of your design.
As you start to design your characters, ask yourself, 
* what kind of game do I want to make? 
* what purposes will my character have to serve in my game?
