# Find Your Character

## Studio Visit with Robertryan Cory

Robertryan Cory had a long career in animation. 
He started at age 15, working as an in-betweener 
and later as a character designer for shows like Spongebob, Gravity Falls, 
Ren & Stimpy, and many others.
Robertryan Cory has a bunch of great artwork to check out online. Here are some links!

I challenged Cory to create designs for two characters that would fit in a 
street-fighter-style video game, set in the world of amateur backyard wrestling. 
The characters would all be farm animals, the first a pig and the other a goat. 
I suggested Cory think of a couple wrestlers we both remembered from childhood, 
and use them as reference, so he could make the Pig an obnoxious wanna-be millionaire like 
"The Million Dollar Man" and the goat could be a wildman like "The Ultimate Warrior." 

### Drawing the Pig

I know a lot of artists, when they're thinking of doing character design
they wanna get super fancy tools so could you talk a bit about
why you've got some Crayola stuff mixed in there with the fancy stuff?
Yeah, actually I guess it's kind of, I developed a lot of stuff
from a guy named Ed Benedict, who's a character designer.

He designed the Flintstones and Yogi Bear.
I studied under him when I was very young,
and he kinda organized all his stuff like this too.
The Crayola stuff, I don't know, it's like $3 for a pack of 50.
And they're better than any Tombows, or
any of the art supplies that you get at a art store, where they sell them for free.
And they're kinda fun when you're done with them.
I just chuck them across the room.
Like there's something there's a bit of relief in that.
And then specifics about just this pencil is actually from 1923 or something.
It's one of my favorite pencils.
It's called the Eagle Diagraph and
it has like a little bit of a perforated age or something down here.
And basically the lead on it is incredible.
And of course I have black wings and charcoals and brawls and
stuff and some of these are Mitsubishi in Japan actually makes pencils.
Some of these are really cool and then I have the dumb Crayola stuff and they just,
I don't know they work really well for what I'd like to do.
Especially I brought the Crayolas out because I knew I was gonna do some drawing
and sometimes doing really fast drawings, the Crayolas they just glide really fast
and then you can go over on with a black pen and kinda get stuff done really fast.

But yeah, Ed Benedict kind of always keep it sharpened and
specifically, and I've tried attempting that.
But this is just the one I travel, I've been actually taking this back and
forth to Disney which is where I'm working at right now.
So it makes it easy and so
I have all my special pencils that I like to usually use and
then I don't have to have two different sets that can just bring with me.
So that's kind of why it's set up that way.

Just my thought process if you I'll kind of talk it about while I'm
sort of kind of putting stuff down.
Automatically I go, okay, well what's the thing that communicates kind
of someone who holier-than-thou, but completely wrong, and that's the pig in his own crap.
So, usually, when I kinda start doing this stuff, I start blocking
stuff off pretty quickly and it's almost kind of like how, 
and fighters a lot of the time too, they end up using like,
there's a hit box around everything and so everything has to be within precision.
It's almost in and outs and that works well with animation and
it's also almost how you have to block things off for mass structure.
Cuz if something's hanging too much out of a hit box you don't want
to be huge target.
You wanna have advantages and stuff and you wanted it to make sense and
communicate certain ideas and stuff.
So right away you just kinda **start blocking off mass**.
It's almost like abstract a little bit when you do this kind of stuff.
Where you just sort of like, okay,
well this is kind of you have this where do lines come in as.
This is the nose,
this is the eyes I'm just kinda figuring out the mass part of it.

And then I'll be **thinking kind of the character part of it** which is,
okay, well you're talking about a million dollar man and
kind of like I'm trying to envision that kind of big but pompous and stuff.
So it's, I keep thinking, okay, well I want obviously his bigness to
read the most and so his body mass would be the most important shape and
everything around that will kind of be muted.
You want the character to read and the shape part of this.
So I'll start kind of like blocking in where did I want the,
how much mass distribution one way.
I kind of be thinking about.
I also need it to move and be functional so it's how much of it.
And I'll be doing a lot of little doodling right now that will look like garbage.
So just **figuring out how much of the shape**,
cuz I want it to be a brawler but I also want it to be.
It's communicating a lot of different things and so
specific can be great because if you have a vision right away for
stuff then you can zero in on it probably faster.
But if there's a lot of areas you can go into you kind of go well, I have
this issue I need to confront, but I'll also have this issue I need to resolve.
And, so, for me, **character is the most important**
I wanna make sure that that gets communicated,
more than the design, almost.
I'm willing to throw out most designer principles in order to make sure
it communicates with an audience, like something very specific.
A lot of stuff I end up doing for
my jobs ends up being humorous, even the video game stuff I worked on.
I worked on a Konami skating video game that's Funko and it was a humorous one.

But, I actually played a lot of fighting games, and one of my favorite designers
is a guy named CRM, let me make sure I get it right.
Because, he goes by aliases. is name's Bengus.
Sometimes he gets called CRMK, and that's the guy who designed all of Capcom's
fighting games in Japan, and he's very great.
He's actually influenced by another artist who does
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Keepa, I think is his name.
And he also is an awesome influence by an American comic book artist named Jim Lee
who now runs DC.
He did all the Marvel versus Capcom artwork based on
Jim Leaves rendition but he kind of found the bridge between those two designs.
I think a lot of designers end up, the ones who end up becoming really good,
kind of do that they find the idea of marrying
things that people maybe didn't think about really well.
They look and go, oh, this kinda connects here.

Where it came from for me is I was looking at this guy, or
I was listening to a band called Deerhoof.
And they were talking about deconstruction.
And I didn't know deconstruction existed in art, at that point.
I was, oh, this sounds amazing.
I started thinking, well how would you do that in art?
How would you do it in cartooning specifically?
And so they were saying, in their version of deconstruction, what they were doing is
they were making jingles, something that would just play on a commercial,
and then they were deconstructing it and adding noise to it, and
seeing how far they could remove it from the jingle, without ruining its
underlying appeal, like that jingle has.
So I was like, what's the most appealing thing in the world, and I thought Sanrio.
And then I ended up
kind of doing shell like drawings where I would do a Sanrio shell and
then I would draw something disturbing inside and see how like distorted.
So a lot of those things that that movement of art is coming out right now
is basically the beginnings of distorting Japanese
cute shells and that's kind of where that full art style comes from.
So it's like a marriage of those ideas.

One other things, when I start feeling design,
I **art making the expressions**o of the characters.
And, when I'm really happy with a design, I start making noises.
Depending on what I'm drawing, I actually have music setup for
different types of inspiration to.
I have music that set up when I decide to draw a lot of monsters so, for people.
So a lot of the music that I listen to is sometimes just really scary electronic
music or symphonies and stuff.
And then I'll listen to certain musicians, I will just get lots of visions.
I get these kind of visions where I'll listen to a song and I'll get
a specific idea and every time I listen to that song I will see that vision.
And so I'll just have to draw it,
it just has to come like out of me when I listen to the song.
And then, kind of when they draw it, it's hard to enjoy that song again,
cuz it's like oh, I've already figured it out, this part of it out.

Students see, especially with video games, so much of characters in a t-pose,
but I've noticed that,
when designing almost no designers work in sort of a strict what I mean?
They're all working in sort of a pose that gives a little more personality
to a character.
I've worked in T-pose stuff for
CD stuff, especially Penguins of Madagascar and
stuff and it's discouraging, to say the least.
You don't feel anything.
I tend to think of character right away in 3/4s.
3/4 communicates what you need it to.
You end up getting a lot of just the personality and stuff, and you can
always base everything out of the three quarters so there's not any real tricks.
You can't hide behind something,
a front, or something else can hide.
You can render something and then have to problem solve it later.
And that's not good, you don't want to get into problem solving when you've fallen in
love with the design and a specific view because then when you do that
you just end up getting very sad all the time,
because you realize you gonna have to change so much of stuff.
And the **funnctionality** is the most important thing in all design.
If it doesn't function, it's an illustration at that point.
And so you kinda do have to make sure.
It would be cool in some ways to be sitting down with someone who would be
modelling this and kinda going back and
forth with them too because even though I will attempt to make sure that I don't add
anything in here that can't be figured out in animation,
you can always see stuff in animation and just be like oh shoot.
That's not gonna work out for
this kinda stuff, especially in a video game, in a fighter, like I said,
the boxed stuff, you kinda have to go, oh, is this gonna be a grappler?
Is this gonna be they call them shojins.
Or I can't remember all those stupid names for them all I know is how they play and
that's is this a person that pushes the other player across the screen or
is it someone that needs to come in close?
And that kind of determines the animation movement and stuff if someone needs to
coming close, then obviously they don't need to grab someone as much.
They grab people, but they don't have to have extended long limbs.
Someone who pushes people back a little bit is more defensive player.
That's the kind of player that you're
gonna have to extend out the limb.
So this guy can get a little bit more blocky, is what I'm saying.
Cuz I'm seeing him as a kind of a grappler cuz of his mass.

If you I can pull a couple of sketchbooks out in the other room and
I draw straight ahead in ink lots of times.
There's a lot of stuff in design where I'll be going back and forth.
I do multiple passes and that's the thing I'm more
worry about communicating to an audience,
especially in a kinda film like this, or study thing.
I love talking about design.

The first thing you'll realize when you get a job,
to all the students listening to this, is you'll be so thankful.
You'll be like wow, I can't believe this.
And you get your paycheck and you'll just be like I never thought this would happen.
And by then all of a sudden you'll be like I'm giving my entire life to doing 60
hours or 70 hours and then you kind of go back and forth between you
will end up having moments where you're just like giving it all to your job and
then you have moments when you're like, I have nothing more to give.
And I think that's just a natural process because being an artist doesn't turn off.
Especially being a designer, you end up, once you start getting into the tunnel
vision of seeing the world in this thing, it never really goes away.
And you have to learn, I've just been learning
last few years it's like actually sit down and
make sure I get time do other things.
To reading, to taking vacations,
to doing things that I care about cuz I used to only give it to art.
And I used to think, well if I'm not doing it in art, then I'm letting people down.
Or I'm not good enough to continue having my job.
But I think you just end up,
at a certain point you just get more confident as you do it.
But you also realize you spend more time out of commission after being burnt out
than if you just did like that, what's the word I'm looking for, renewable energy.
This is the same as the environment.
There's a point in your life where you're planting seeds.
And then your harvesting crops but
the part of farming the people forget all the time is actually resting the soil.

All of design is design.
And we were talking a little bit about the soft which is just like.
It's all the same principals, it's **evity of communication**.
And there certain principles I will talk about a little bit while I'm doing this.
So certain principles that you can have write away is head's tall
on every character.
The less head's tall things line up to be equal the more interesting the design is.
Cuz it's a contrast thing but
the more equal it is the more appealing it is.
And that's just the balance of design.
Design itself is a balance of mass.
So because he's a pig, I kind of want this mass to be the biggest.
I can take this mass right here and I can draw it separately.
And I can take all the arms and legs and I can put that mass together.
The greater the difference, the more high contrast, and
actually will even look more sinister.
But it'll also just be very high **contrasted** and really **design-looking**.
And then the **more equal** it is, the **more appealing** it will be.
So, **design is just the balance of those two things**, of working back and
forth between those principles.
How much do I need to make this appealing?
And, how much of this do I need to make interesting, just for the design's sake?
And, design, in general, for CGI I wish they would go back and
manipulate things, because they're getting better at rendering,
and allowing for more, detail on things,
and so then they think oh I'm gonna hide this thing like this,
guy's gonna have this battle scar and it's gonna communicate he was in a war.
And they get so in their head about the design and, it's like,
you're not going to communicate that by having this little,
tiny scar that you only see when you come in at a certain angle.
If you really wanna someone to look war-torn, you can do it in a big,
general way, and then never again, and not do it in a million tiny little ways.
So, that's the kind of way
I try to think of it is, what's the quickest way to do it?
And in a big way, so there's no questioning like okay,
what is he trying to say here?

### Refining the Pig
The passes that do they are not just nonsense.
A lot of that was figuring out how does
this actually look when it is rendered out in comparison to a little sketch.
And then through that, you can see a lot more problems.
And so one of the things that I start going through and
anyone can do this to any design.
Again, a lot of the stuff I will be talking about won't just
be I don't want people to think like oh well this is a thing for
animation or this is for fighting or whatever it is.
You can do it, you can do it to a twinkie wrapper.

So, when you know what you need people to focus on,
there's a **clean up technique** that you can use.
And that is, so, I want his body to be the biggest shape.
I want his mass, and stomach to communicate he's this big brawler.
He's a bit cocky.
And one of the things you can do in all design, is that,
what your focus is, you can actually go over and render outside of the line
to create more mass, so I'm cleaning up just outside of the line,

and just by doing that in this and
I can actually go in on the arm, so maybe you can off shift it a little bit so
I don't want to lose the mass on the shoulder so I'll go on the outside.
Of this line for the arm but then I need it to taper a little bit.
So, go on the inside, here.
By doing that, right away, you end up getting slightly
higher contrast in your designs.
You can do it on, like I said, you can take one of your favorite artist's,
you know, pieces of work and you can improve the contrast on their design
relatively fast by doing that little technique and I kinda
do it as I'm cleaning stuff up too, myself; but I don't want to lose my focus.
One of the things, I was putting little marks on here which is like

Another thing I think about when I start going through it,
is I start going, like, I always draw way too many details, when I first start,
and I always go, and I don't need half of this stuff.
Because so much of it,
it's like, is it necessary, to communicate all of this stuff.
So, I will take things and another concept of design is that
**organic shapes** work well in details of one, three, five,
seven, and you can go to nine but I don't recommend it.
And then **mechanical details** work well in two, four, six, eight.
10 and what that means is if you're drawing a tank and
you put two bolts next to each other it adds that element of mechanic to it.
It's the symmetry.
It makes things look dead.
But then what you can do is if guys like Moebius and Masamune Shiro
he would,
they would add organic details to mechanic things,
to make them almost look alive, and then on Spongebob what we would do is we
would add mechanic details to organic things, to make it look more humorous.
So, it's double stripes that are even and symmetrical, and
that's kind of just like Naturally what you do.
But as I'm going through this,
what I will be doing is I'll be going does it need this much detail?
And right away on the legs,
I'm thinking man I don't know if I need to break it off.
So, I have two bumps here and I will just be trying out
Is it necessary, can I do it in one shape rather than two.
And seeing how that looks as I do it,
and seeing how if it can even function.
Because another thing I have to make sure is that it can be modeled
that's not necessary for just showing a little bit, but
it's something you should be thinking about as a designer.
Don't think about is it a good drawing, think about does it serve it's purpose?
And if your purpose is that this is gonna get modeled, and rendered and animated And
a lot of times you need to go,
is this mask even something that I could rotate around and stuff?
So, you just think about that stuff a lot.
And you end up thinking a lot of like, okay.
Is this too difficult for somebody else to replicate?
I hung out with a programmer recently from Seattle, and
I was telling him I grew up around a lot of programmer.
One of my friends is a programmer on League of Legends,
and he was my friend that I grew up with.
And he was coding is a lot like design where it's the brevity,
like the thing that impresses people in coding is like, oh wow,
you figured out how to compress this into, you know, something that was 18 lines,
into, you know even they get impressed if it's down to like 16.


And so I was telling him about it.
I was like, oh yeah it's kind of like in design in how he, we do that too.
And he's like, well now the way coding works is more of like
canvas code be handed off to someone who's never coded before or
has very limited coding experience.
And it's so elementary that it doesn't how much, cuz they can fit so
much information now.
Now, it's more important that you be able to communicate it to somebody who
maybe does have your knowledge and

I feel like maybe design is heading towards that way too.
It's so simple.
That anybody else can pick it up and things that be coming
the the culture are almost all things that are very simple
and almost could be replicated, but maybe not exactly.
There's a lot of that fad art is what I'm trying to say,
but there's something that speaks to it, I think.
So, I'm just trying to find certain shapes.
We can move onto another animal in a second.

One thing I'm curious about with this design is there's so many round forms.
And I have a lot of trouble designing of a character that's this
round because when I try to do it often times it'll start feeling marshmallowy.
How do you balance that much roundness in a character?

Well, I guess I want it to communicate
that it's round because I want the pig shapes.
If I get into too much.
If I get into too intricate of shapes too,
that is kind of talking about that programming thing,
which is that I want someone else to be able to take this and to duplicate it.
one of the things I used to do when I was starting
off as I actually do almost like a wire frame on something.
I would find the shape on it and I would come in, and
I would actually put the wire frame to make sure that things wrapped around Now,
I don't do that as much because I kinda like have an innate
ability to look at something and see the construction.
So, a lot of balancing out of like, shapes that even if there's a similarity
of bulk pattern going on and that,
I'm basically seeing the form in it, I mean, that belly button may not be exactly
there but it's almost where it would be if I was to render exactly out and that just
comes from years of designing where you go okay this is kind of where it goes out.
But I started it all off by originally
Doing almost all of the work, drawing through shapes.
Making sure things connected.
But I'm just trying to communicate the shapes right now for
the camera of like, okay, this is the balance of everything.
Cuz Whether this gets done as 2D or
3D it wouldn't even matter at this point.
Cuz the shapes are basic enough that they could work in either one.
And that's kinda what you wanna do in everything you're working on.
Is don't get caught up in the illustration part of it,
just like the underlying shape and the function of it.

if this was something that
you were following me at work I would probably do
a bunch of like things where I would sit down and
I would you know, stretch it all out and
like figure out like how much of this how can I move and
I would need to know more, like, gosh, more like
Okay, this is for a mobile game.
This is for a 2D animation series.
Whatever the rule set is, then I would start going okay.
If this was gonna be rendered in 3D, I'd have to go okay,
now I have to show the under part of this.
There's all that kind of stuff, but I would realize,
okay, well I might have to move this mouth over here.
And it might always be like, right now I'm giving it a slight impression.
Because we talked about him being a little bit cocky.

But I could technically just put it there and
you would just go okay all my expressions have to go within this rule set.
And then you just kind of mess around with it.
Sometimes you would just take post-its or you can do it on.
It doesn't matter how you would do it but you would just go
okay these are the parameters and now how much of this can I just move.
With cg stuff you tend to just move eyebrows and mouths.
The other stuff you don't really move a lot.
And then with 2d animations, obviously you can move a lot more and
you can get more expressive.
I almost specifically work in expression in hands.
It's a technique I learned when I was younger.
Which is like, once you get those two down, almost everything else comes in,
the character comes around it.
So, once you figure out this kind of stuff you can
kind of just start playing with the expression a little bit.
And that's just the animation part of it where you're just
kind of playing with the shapes.
This is kinda the basic under watch, let me finish up these feet,
of where I would probably be moving the design, but I might still come in and
This might not be the thing that I would present to someone, actually.
This would be the starting point of where I go,
okay this is kind of feeling like a character to me.
It kind of has a little bit of the wrestling, like Jim,
he's got the top hat that's like okay, he's kind of a slob.
But I might circle himm does it communicate like
the wrestling pose part of it.
Right now he's kind of like more gimmicky and kind of thing.
So, one of the things I would start probably doing is after that I would
start messing with that, I would do the different kinds of expressions and And
trying to find, what is, does the thing communicate what I need it to communicate?
And a thing that you would bring to an art director or a producer would be,
I would do a couple passes where I would figure out, okay,
maybe I get rid of this, maybe I maneuver this around, maybe I put in a pose.
And what you do is you organize it, it's a whole game of manipulation,
this whole industry.

What you do is you take your second favorite drawing and
you put that up front in your presentation.
And you never put your favorite upfront, you put that second and
the reason why is you, you don't want to put your worst stuff up front because then
they become highly critical of everything that they're about to review.
But you don't want to put the first one because they will
almost never go with that decision and
they will always end up going oh no this is kind of interesting but.
So, that's why they tell me don't fall in love with your designs.
They, you want to, somebody will come in and
I will think I have solved every problem.
And they'll go,
you know, I just don't like square teeth.
Can we see how, and then, in your mind,
you can go Square teeth are absolutely essential for this design.
There's no other way, and you've just, you have that tunnel vision.
And then they're coming in and they were like,
can you take the teeth from this one design and can you put that and can you?
Like, sometimes you have to read through that and
a designer will be like, what are they really trying to communicate?

They're telling me square teeth don't work here and
they're coming up with a simple solution.
And I'm like, why is this?
So, then you have to go back.
I feel like that, when you're doing revisions like that you end up kind of,
like I said a lot of this job is trying to figure out like,
what is this person who's not very good at communicating trying to tell me?
And the best directors are the guys who do the little sketches that are really rough.
Because when you see those guys,
they can tell you really quickly what they want and zero in on it.
And the worst directors are the ones who are like I don't know,
I was thinking about this, and they're talking about a lot of concepts.
And you just like go back to your desk and go oh my God.

### Drawing the Sheep
I'm trying to block out the shapes and figure out the balance
on something lie this cuz you gotta give him a long neck, and when you give him
the long neck like if you put too muscular of a body it looks funny, but
it can sometimes bring in a balance of the shape.
It's just too much to focus on.
If the neck's too long, then it usually ends up losing some mass
and it kind of like, the way this animal's head
connects is almost like its neck is not that different than the width of its face.
Its eyeballs are kind of on the outside which is funny.

So you wanna make sure that that gets communicated.
It's almost all neck to hair and then if you make the body too big,
then you're gonna look at the body and not at the weird head.
So but I do want to get some poses too that convey wild man.
So I'm gonna start like configuring some of this out this balance and stuff.

Trying
to think of things that I might know not
just in life but in other characters.
I'm trying to think of characters that kind of possess
similar shapes and ideas and stuff like that,
insanity and a little off-ness in general.

Also thinking about making sure that it feels different then the pig.
For sure, you know.
I mean, a lot of that, the best design in the world always,
people, you can just look at the silhouettes
of all the characters lined up and you can tell who is what just based on that.
A silhouette or a mass or a shape is too similar where and
in a way it almost feels like it's bad design because it just almost ends up
communicating the same thing, redundancy over and over again.
You know and it doesn't feel iconic.
Lot of design like Simpsons and stuff like that.
You could see the silhouette of every one of their heads, and you would know
exactly what character it is and there's nothing that even comes close.
Even though Bart and Lisa are relatively same age, there's nothing that
looks similar to them or even like you could go to Bart's friends, Milhouse and
stuff and they all feel very different, they all feel very unique.
That in the Simpsons, it's still not even the most designed show in the world,
but they get that part of it right and I think that most design that
is successful kind of has that and
the color, because I've noticed that's one way, for instance, a double dragon.
The two characters are basically the same except for color.
I think that's a memory thing.
But now even though we have tons of memory, it saves labor but
there's a, it's still the most by changing the color,
do you ever work with color while you're coming up with initial designs?

a lot of my designs I kind of will get in to a theme, and
also when I'm working on stuff where I'm trying to present it to people,
It's a weird I might work in blues and greens kind of get convey that.
It helps me get into it too to be honest.
It's not just trying to sell the idea to somebody but you can kind of
get into it a little bit more by using certain kinds of colors but as far as like
do I see the final color of the character when I'm doing it.
I don't at all.
I mostly see the shape of something.
I'm almost always just specifically struggling with that, and
I'll sometimes go to a colorist afterwards, and
I'll be like, I was thinking of this, but don't let what I'm thinking hold you back.
I did a character, a monster for
Gravity Falls, it was based off a Vietnamese eggroll I had.
Many years ago, I just remember looking at it and
that it looked so kind of translucent that you could see all of the carrots and
everything and it just disgusted me in a weird way and
I got obsessed with it so I did this shape shifter character.
So I was telling him, I want to get this like Vietnamese egg roll where the inside
of it is shaping the shape of the outside, just like conforms to it and
I saw it in the same colors I usually see stuff.
I saw in blues and greens and these weird shit colors.
That's how I saw it until someone talked to the director and he was like I'm
thinking white and it wasn't a color that I would've picked, probably.
It's probably, I mean I'm not a great colorist in that regard
but when I saw it I was like well this is the way it should have been.
It was so high contrast.
It was super creepy.
You know there's something that I just loved about it.
When they finally saw it, so.

I think it's good, though, that I didn't focus so much on the color aspect of it,
when I was designing it because I think, sometimes,
there's a lot of good artists who are great colorists and
winds up happening, is they hind behind color and
right now it's very popular to use very neutral muted colors and
it's kinda used in a lot of anime's and video games too.
And by muting the colors it can feel like realistic lighting, and
can make people feel like you know a specific way about a character right away
but they don't do the underlying work of the character underneath it you know?
I feel like if a character design is really great you can turn it to black and
white and it still functions and works really well so
I keep sort of seeing this sort of shapes.
I'm trying to get the ultimate warrior aspect of it, but also a little bit
more crazier than him, so I'm trying to see those shapes right now.
Just if you want to know what my process 
I keep seeing the separation of the limbs, it's almost insect like more than it is.
So, this is a llama of some sort.
It's almost like I'm seeing it more insect
like than I'm seeing it.
it seems like you're shrinking the body down.
yeah just so I can get the lens separated out and
I'm getting silhouettes, kind of.
I keep seeing this one balance of shapes over and over again and
I'm thinking that's probably the shape.
So the sign that I have upstairs, let's get back to the point,
it says, No design is ever finished.
You could f with it til forever, but eventually you just have to go,
enough is enough and walk away from it and that's design for you.

There's no perfect design.
Every design can always be slightly perfected upon and so a lot of
the way I view design lately has been about like okay,
what you did get done in the day is kind of like that's how you measure design now.
So it's, oh this was a good day for
drawing, or this was an okay day and then you build upon that rhythm.
It's a slightly different way than I would have approached it.
I think when I was younger and
did first designing I would beat the good design out of the bad design.
I'd just sit there and keep drawing and keep drawing it.
Until I felt like I had somewhere where I was going and so
I kind of keep repeating myself and
trying to see something, but I think I need to go larger at this point,
to kind of get the character portion of it out.

Well when I was talking a little bit during the pick, but
I'll repeat just to make sure is one of the things she, Lynn Naler,
discussed with me and I found out she learned it from Ed Benedict and
I've since used it, which was of it, was this mass relation.
It's the focal mass versus the supporting mass of a character and
so where you want people to look at, that's the focal mass and so
you can kind of do a rough sketch, and you can kind of go, okay, this is,
I need them to look at this face and so you can build everything upon that.
And you can have more than one focal mass but
then you take those two shapes, and you clump them together.
That mass, the greater the difference between that and
the other, so the supporting mass, that's a high contrast design and
it's usually the principle of design but
the closer and more symmetrical those are the more appealing it is and so
you will see that high contrast design in a villain of some sort.
Let me come up with something cultural.
Has very like what's her name Maleficent?
It's that from Sleeping Beauty.
It's very high contrast very high angles.
Everything you look at the top.
You almost don't look at anything on the bottom so
if you take that mass of hers on top and you take the mass of the bottom
it's actually more on top than there is on the bottom.
Very high contrast but you look at Sesame Street and
everything in Sesame Street is even.
There's no right way or wrong way for any of this stuff.
You can go like well this is how a design should
be but what ends up happening a lot of times is you just kind of like I want
people to like the design but I also want it to be scary or to make an impact.
I want it to be like nothing else.
All of those things need an understanding of design but
they also need a balance of appeal to get someone into it.

Aaron wants me to design is kind of like more like a comic strip.
It's so different from how I used to design.
I joined animation when I was 15, so
this is my 21st year now working in animation.

It's way longer.
I thought I was going to be a painter, and
now I've been working animation more years than I haven't.
It's crazy to me, but at the same time there's new challenges all the time.
It's seriously challenging how I think about design more and more.
He doesn't let me go over a drawing, so the way I would naturally work and
how I'm working for you guys isn't how I'm working right now.
Currently, I will actually start a new drawing every single time, and
it's more like a comic strip.
It's like doing Garfield and so it's like the progression of like where Garfield
went from like 77 to like 83 and you're doing that in like a day or two days.
Well that also reminds of what you're talking about with the contrast in design
elements, Garfield started with a huge
loaf of a cat with a little tiny face 

Yeah and also I think
as a character progresses and stuff, whatever the character is that
you're working on, the more you draw it, the more you
live with it you almost feel like you figure out the appeal side of it so much.
You figure out what people like about it, and
you almost keep giving the audience what they want, and so
as anything progresses, it just becomes more appealing and less contrast.
I think that just is the nature of design,
in some way, or just maybe, the nature of commercialism, where it's like,
the more something sells, the more you don't want to not cater to an audience.
The weird thing though is with Peanuts,
I feel like they got less appealing as they got older.
Well that's because I think that his health you know and
his determination to not use assistance.
You know Shulz, e was adamant that he did not wanna be more like Mort Walker.
He had a lot of friends who worked in comic strips who I think he admired them,
but didn't admire how they gave up the drawing aspect of it,
so he had a stroke and then he ended up drawing very,
like it was suffrage.
It's crazy how different it is but in some ways
it's kind of appealing in a different way, which is that it's more limited.
He didn't, it's not as precise and
it's not as like perfectly round but
it's got like, a very limited,
what's the word I'm looking for?
It's just not rendered, it's not labored over.

### Refining the Sheep, Part 1
So, you've got the rough?
Maybe you could explain a bit like where you are now in the process?
>> Yeah, I kind of have a little bit of a rough idea.
I feel like I keep coming to certain patterns over and over again with this.
And so, it's like, okay, I have to move on a little bit and start finding the design.
It's a little bit still, for me, cloudy.
And the way I've always explained drawing to people who don't draw, sometimes people
go, oh, what's it like for you when you draw in your sketch book straight ahead?
I can do that aspect for it, but it's not design.
It's a cloudy image behind a shower curtain for me.
That's how I've always seen drawing.
And then it slowly gets revealed to me as I'm drawing it.
So, almost all the thought process of it can't happen.
It's not like I can sit there and I go, all I have a clear image in my head,
now I can just draw it.
The way it's always worked for me is that I've always seen something behind
a shower curtain and I'm like, okay, there's something here.
But I need to put the pencil to paper in order to really start like seeing it
a little bit more.
And I go, well, no, that doesn't look that's what was in my mind.
It wasn't this.
And you kind of just, you keep pressing it, and experimenting with
it until you find that image that you're seeing over and over again.
And the more you draw as you get older, the clearer, I think,
the image in your head becomes of what you're about to draw.

If there's a point where it gets crystal clear, it hasn't happened for me yet.
I've been trying to do it a long [LAUGH], all the time, and
it's still so much like jazz improv.
When you're doing it, you're like,
I kinda know what the basics of what is going on here.
So, I keep seeing these eye patterns, that's like eight kind of thing.
And then I'm like, well, it kind of repeats and nose, and
I'm trying to find that balance of it and seeing like it's the wild and thing.
And like I said, it's almost becoming more insect for me than a barn animal.
But I will hopefully at some point,
pull it together in rendering where you will just like go, oh yeah,
now that's where it comes together and you can kind of see it a little bit more.

Where it actually will look like a farm animal [LAUGH],
not like a weird parasite of some sort.
But you kinda have to go with
the idea that you're seeing otherwise.

You keep experimenting and trying different shapes.
And then like I said, with designs nothing's ever perfect.
So, you just end up going, this isn't it, this isn't it.
Sometimes by failing too, I'm a big proponent of failure.

Failure is like how you get oh, okay,
that is how it was suppose to be the entire time.
I had to fail three to five times.
When I was younger, the woman who thought me design and
she was always like oh, I draw everything 12 times.
I was like, 12 times.
I thought that you actually had to count too, so even if I got the design
together in five, I would still go over it [LAUGH]
until it was 12 because I was a very good student at first.
The basis for design in general should be,
these are the tool sets and
I'll figure out why they're the tool sets.
I figured out the appeal one just from experimenting with the high contrast one.
And also there's a logical end to design.
That's a thing that people probably don't talk about enough which is that,

If you learn to be a good designer, a lot of things end up just looking
the same because there is a conclusion if you follow one set of tools.
Oh, to it's logical end, you will always get the same kind of outcome to it.
But, where's the pink pencil?
Then when you keep getting the same kind of conclusions over and over again,
then you kind of have to go, oh, I need to figure out, I need to break this.
I need to put something else.
Everything's looking the same, it's looking a little boring.
So I think that's how the appeal part of it worked for me, at least,
was that I was like well everything at that point in animation.
Think all designs like Samurai Jack and
very like two whistle plump and boon's tired and stuff and
everyone figured out the good stuff at this point.
You kind of need to go like what's the dumbest thing [LAUGH] to design and
that's kind of where I started going with design.
I was like what would be the dumbest thing I could do in this situation and
not thinking what's the smartest thing you could do.
That kind of opened the door to design for me where I started seeing stuff more.
I'm seeing the challenge part of it, but at the same time,
I don't want it to look furry.
[LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]
>> There's a very scary closeness where
you could end up just doing an animal that just looks like
fucking Tiny Toons or something.
[LAUGH] I don't know.
[LAUGH] I didn't mean to curse.

My actual fear isn't the time.
You guys can take as long as you're willing to take.
I know that you guys got other lives too, but.
For me, I'm more about the problem, I'm like, how is this gonna get solved?
I'm so focused on.
[LAUGH] Like it's actually gonna get made.
[LAUGH] That's how I approach everything.
No, no, this has got to be figured out.
What's the solution?
>> I think pushing the nose further from the eyes is-
>> Yeah, it's something in there.

Yeah, maybe you should come sit down with me with a pencil,
that's the way we should do this interview.
[LAUGH] Just give me a second.
I'm seeing it.
>> Yeah, okay.
And you're drawing those lines to kind of measure things out?
>> Yeah, it's still totally going to change, and stuff like that.
But I do kind of try to balance it out.
There's a shape that I did in the rough,
where it's kind of an interesting geometric shape.
But then you don't want things to get too geometric.
You do want them to be able to be rendered, and figured out bur you kind of
have to want some elements of play and design in there.
Like I said, all design is kind of like the same, no matter what you're doing.
So, the rendering part of it really doesn't matter if I was

going to end up doing a brochure, I would approach it slightly differently but
not as differently as people might expect.
It's kind of just in the rendering part of it.
You use the flat stuff to kinda figure out the angles but
then you kinda have to go back in and make sure it has a form behind it.
It can move, it's not just all geometry and
beautiful shapes, stuff like that.
Wanna make sure you get that balance of like,
okay these are the kind of shapes that can move.
Also, like I said, I feel like I over do everything until I get to the end.
And the editing process for me is so
much more important than even the anything beforehand.
Lots of times I have this feeling when I'm designing of,
why couldn't I get here faster?
This took so long to get to this spot.
Why couldn't I just do it naturally?
Like I said, when I draw in a sketchbook I actually draw straight ahead in pen.

And so that stuff,
it's like a different part of my brain than the character part of it.
I don't know why, it's a different process for me.
So part of the thing I get so
frustrated with is the journey that I have to go through to find the character.
And to resolve the thing I have in my mind.
But it's the thing that means so
much to me is like when I see the character come out of it.
It's like you fight it, you fight it.
And you kind of like, what is this, what is this?
It's showing me something it's almost here and
then you eventually come to the conclusion.
You're almost like, I can't wait to show somebody this.
I don't know, it's like this weird feeling,
it's like frustration but at the same time when you get it,
you're very, like you can feel it before it's finished.
You know it.
There's an excitement to it.
When I was first starting design, I would sometimes get afraid during that time,
I would be like, uh-oh, it's getting good, it's getting good.
Don't mess it up.
I had that fear all the time.
Like don't do the thing that's going to ruin this.
And I would sometimes, and that was always, it was a real threat,
it wasn't a threat that it was like, oh, obviously it always worked out.
There's plenty of times where I had the design 75% done, and I'm like, this is
great, don't mess it up, and I would mess it up, and I'd be like, oh, dang it.
And then you just have to look at the time that you have left on something go like,
do I have enough time to go back over it.
[LAUGH] I always personally made more time for myself cuz I, like I said
that's the thing I care the most about is the design element that it don't,

Trying not to like get into the other.

Everything else to voice that thing, the color, all of that stuff.
It's interesting stuff to think about and to play with.
But for me it's like, if it doesn't communicate the character for
me, then I don't want to do it.
>> Where do you see the problem still with this design?
What are you still trying to fix?
>> I guess I just feel like it's not a character yet still, I don't know, I

feel like I'm seeing like it's just shapes right now.
I'm not feeling a connection to it.
I also feel like there needs to be some resizing going on.
I'm enjoying the shapes that I'm picking up, but I'm not feeling anything yet
of like a connection to the character or even the description,
I guess is what you know that kind of wild man shape.
I'm sort of embarrassed [LAUGH] about it right now.
I'm just like, man I need this to come together.
Yeah sorry, sometimes it takes awhile.
>> That's okay.

One thing I was noticing is, his hair is very quaffed right now.
>> Oh, well that's just the framing part of it.
That part will change.
That's just figuring out the perimeter.
Again, I figure out where the edge is.
In fact, I might even bring it in more.
>> You know what it is?
I think the torso's starting to be a different size than the head.
>> Yeah, I'm finding it a little bit more.
But, yeah.
I don't know, for me, like I said, so much of it unfortunately.
I don't design in a way that, I'm sorry that
it's not like that where it's like, oh okay.
Here's the 20 minute design and here's the thing.
I have to match so many different styles in the things.
The thing I'm working on now is so opposite of this too, so you have to
go back to different the things and you're just thinking about different things.
I don't know.
For me, design is just like it's so not a formula and but a formula too?
[LAUGH] It's just like there's ideas and things that are like, I don't know.
And I'm such a crazy perfectionist in that way where I am looking for
that ideal design, I think you have to approach it that way.
I'll be thinking about this after you guys leave today,
even though this isn't going to be, this is an exercise, this is a challenge.
I would still be going, how would I really solve this?
How would I do this?
Is there a better solution to it?
I think it's the nature of design.
You have to be that way.
I used to always say how unfortunately,

people who are creative, they can kind of be a little miserable sometimes.
Because one of the things they do is they are constantly searching for
ways to make things better.
So they get off of work and they're like, they're sitting there all day and
going like, I don't know, this could be like this.
What if we did this, what if we did this?
So then you get off work, and then you go and eat a sandwich, and then you're like,
oh, that sandwich could have been better.
It could have been good.
It could have done this.
And it never stops.
